For example:\nAllergens that are breathed in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus production, cough, or wheezing. Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or even skin peeling. Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms."

        "input": "What causes Allergy?",
        "output": "The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens, which are generally harmless and in most people do not cause a problem.But in a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, it releases chemicals such as histamines. which fight off the allergen. This causes itching, swelling, mucus production, muscle spasms, hives, rashes, and other symptoms, which vary from person to person.\nCommon allergens include pollen, mold, pet dander, and dust. Food and drug allergies are common. Allergic reactions can also be caused by insect bites, jewelry, cosmetics, spices, and other substances.Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers.\nSometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.A specific allergy is not usually passed down through families (inherited). However, if both your parents have allergies, you are likely to have allergies. The chance is greater if your mother has allergies.\nAllergies may make certain medical conditions such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma worse.Allergies are relatively common. Both genetics and environmental factors play a role."

However, as a general rule, once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it continues to affect the person.\nAllergy shots are most effective when used to treat those with hay fever symptoms and severe insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may require years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis)."

After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. On a later exposure to that allergen, an allergic reaction may occur. This reaction happens quickly after the exposure, is severe, and involves the whole body.\nTissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.\nSome drugs (morphine, x-ray dye, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. Aspirin may also cause a reaction. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with \"true\" anaphylaxis. However, the symptoms, risk for complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:\nDrug allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings\nPollens and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause.\nAnaphylaxis is life-threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction."

        "input": "What causes Drug allergy?",
        "output": "Adverse reactions to drugs are common, and almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\nA true drug allergy results from a series of chemical steps within the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.\nIt can develop two different ways:\nThe first time you take the medicine, you have no problems, but your body's immune system produces a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE, but this is not well understood.\nMost drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after exposure to a medication or vaccine.\nPenicillin and related antibiotics are the most common cause of drug allergies. Other common allergy-causing drugs include:\nSulfa drugs. Anticonvulsants. Insulin preparations (particularly animal sources of insulin). Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like anaphylactoid reactions).\nMost side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered \"idiosyncratic.\" This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication, not due to a predictable chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy, which can be life threatening."

        "output": "Normally, your body's immune system defends against potentially harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. In some people, an immune response is triggered by a substance that is generally harmless, such as a specific food.\nThe cause of food allergies is related to your body making a type of allergy-producing substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to a particular food.\nAlthough many people have a food intolerance, food allergies are less common. In a true food allergy, the immune system produces antibodies and histamine in response to the specific food.\nAny food can cause an allergic reaction, but a few foods are the main culprits. In children, the most common food allergies are to:\nEggs. Milk. Peanuts. Shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster). Soy. Tree nuts. Wheat.\nA food allergy frequently starts in childhood, but it can begin at any age. Fortunately, many children will outgrow their allergy to milk, egg, wheat, and soy by the time they are 5 years old if they avoid the offending foods when they are young. Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish tend to be lifelong.\nIn older children and adults, the most common food allergies are:\nFish. Peanuts. Shellfish. Tree nuts.\nFood additives -- such as dyes, thickeners, and preservatives \u2013 may rarely cause an allergic or intolerance reaction.\nAn allergy syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue may occur after eating certain fresh fruits and vegetables. These foods contain substances similar to certain pollens. For example, melon contains substances similar to ragweed pollen, and apples have allergens similar to tree pollen.\nMany Americans believe they have food allergies, while in reality fewer than 1% have true allergies. Most symptoms are caused by intolerances to foods such as:\nCorn products. Cow's milk and dairy products. Wheat and other gluten-containing grains."

        "output": "There are many methods of allergy testing. Among the more common are:\nSkin tests. Elimination-type tests. Blood tests (including the radioallergosorbent, or RAST, test).\nSKIN TESTS\nSkin tests are the most common. Specific methods vary.\nOne of the most common methods is the prick test. This test involves placing a small amount of suspectedallergy-causing substances on the skin, usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back. Then, the skin is pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface. The health care provider closely watches the skin for signs of a reaction, usually swelling and redness of the site. Results are usually seen within 15-20 minutes. Several allergens can be tested at the same time.\nA similar method involves injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin and watching for a reaction at the site. This is called an intradermal skin test. It is more likely to be used when testing is being done to find out if you are allergy to something specific, such as bee venom or penicillin.\nPatch testing is a method to diagnose allergic reactions on the skin. Possible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours. The health care provider will look at the area in 24 hours, and then again 48 hours later.\nSkin tests are most useful for diagnosing:\nFood allergy. Mold, pollen, animal, and other allergies that cause allergic rhinitis and asthma. Penicillin allergy. Venom allergy. Allergic contact dermatitis.\nELIMINATION TESTS\nAn elimination diet can be used to check for food allergies. An elimination diet is one in which foods that may be causing symptoms are removed from the diet for several weeks and then slowly re-introduced one at a time while the person is watched for signs of an allergic reaction.\nBLOOD TESTS\nBlood tests can be done to measure the amount of immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies to a specific allergen in the blood. This test may be used when skin testing is not helpful or cannot be done\nOther blood tests include:\nAbsolute eosinophil count. Total IgE level.\nPROVOCATION\nProvocation (challenge) testing involves exposing a person to a suspected allergen under controlled circumstances. This may be done in the diet or by breathing in the suspected allergen. This type of test may provoke severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a doctor.\nAnother method is the double-blind test. This method involves giving foods and harmless substances in a disguised form. The person being tested and the provider are both unaware of whether the substance tested in that session is the harmless substance or the suspected food. A third party knows the identity of the substances and identifies them with some sort of code. This test requires several sessions if more than one substance is under investigation.\nWhile the double-blind strategy is useful and practical for mild allergic reactions, it must be done carefully in individuals with suspected severe reactions to foods. Blood tests may be a safer first approach.\nSkin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. Itching may occur if you have a positive reaction to the allergen."

However, if the dose of allergen is excessive, a positive reaction will occur even in persons who are not allergic."

        "input": "How is Pain Treated?",
        "output": "The goal of pain management is to improve function, enabling individuals to work, attend school, or participate in other day-to-day activities. Patients and their physicians have a number of options for the treatment of pain; some are more effective than others. Sometimes, relaxation and the use of imagery as a distraction provide relief. These methods can be powerful and effective, according to those who advocate their use. Whatever the treatment regime, it is important to remember that pain is treatable. The following treatments are among the most common.\nAcetaminophen is the basic ingredient found in Tylenol\u00ae and its many generic equivalents. It is sold over the counter, in a prescription-strength preparation, and in combination with codeine (also by prescription).\nAcupuncture dates back 2,500 years and involves the application of needles to precise points on the body. It is part of a general category of healing called traditional Chinese or Oriental medicine. Acupuncture remains controversial but is quite popular and may one day prove to be useful for a variety of conditions as it continues to be explored by practitioners, patients, and investigators.\nAnalgesic refers to the class of drugs that includes most painkillers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The word analgesic is derived from ancient Greek and means to reduce or stop pain. Nonprescription or over-the-counter pain relievers are generally used for mild to moderate pain. Prescription pain relievers, sold through a pharmacy under the direction of a physician, are used for more moderate to severe pain.\nAnticonvulsants are used for the treatment of seizure disorders but are also sometimes prescribed for the treatment of pain. Carbamazepine in particular is used to treat a number of painful conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia. Another antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, is being studied for its pain-relieving properties, especially as a treatment for neuropathic pain.\nAntidepressants are sometimes used for the treatment of pain and, along with neuroleptics and lithium, belong to a category of drugs called psychotropic drugs. In addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers. Physicians usually try to treat the condition with analgesics before prescribing these drugs.\nAntimigraine drugs include the triptans- sumatriptan (Imitrex\u00ae), naratriptan (Amerge\u00ae), and zolmitriptan (Zomig\u00ae)-and are used specifically for migraine headaches. They can have serious side effects in some people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only under a doctor's care.\nAspirin may be the most widely used pain-relief agent and has been sold over the counter since 1905 as a treatment for fever, headache, and muscle soreness.\nBiofeedback is used for the treatment of many common pain problems, most notably headache and back pain. Using a special electronic machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature. The individual can then learn to effect a change in his or her responses to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, generally without side effects. Similarly, the use of relaxation techniques in the treatment of pain can increase the patient's feeling of well-being.\nCapsaicin is a chemical found in chili peppers that is also a primary ingredient in pain-relieving creams (see Chili Peppers, Capsaicin, and Pain in the Appendix).\nChemonucleolysis is a treatment in which an enzyme, chymopapain, is injected directly into a herniated lumbar disc (see Spine Basics in the Appendix) in an effort to dissolve material around the disc, thus reducing pressure and pain. The procedure's use is extremely limited, in part because some patients may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to chymopapain.\nChiropractic care may ease back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal conditions. It involves \"hands-on\" therapy designed to adjust the relationship between the body's structure (mainly the spine) and its functioning. Chiropractic spinal manipulation includes the adjustment and manipulation of the joints and adjacent tissues. Such care may also involve therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy involves a wide variety of coping skills and relaxation methods to help prepare for and cope with pain. It is used for postoperative pain, cancer pain, and the pain of childbirth.\nCounseling can give a patient suffering from pain much needed support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling. Support groups can provide an important adjunct to drug or surgical treatment. Psychological treatment can also help patients learn about the physiological changes produced by pain.\nCOX-2 inhibitors may be effective for individuals with arthritis. For many years scientists have wanted to develop a drug that works as well as morphine but without its negative side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which promote production of hormones called prostaglandins, which in turn cause inflammation, fever, and pain. The newer COX-2 inhibitors primarily block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side effects sometimes produced by NSAIDs.\nIn 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved a COX-2 inhibitor-celecoxib-for use in cases of chronic pain. The long-term effects of all COX-2 inhibitors are still being evaluated, especially in light of new information suggesting that these drugs may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Patients taking any of the COX-2 inhibitors should review their drug treatment with their doctors.\nElectrical stimulation, including transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), implanted electric nerve stimulation, and deep brain or spinal cord stimulation, is the modern-day extension of age-old practices in which the nerves of muscles are subjected to a variety of stimuli, including heat or massage. Electrical stimulation, no matter what form, involves a major surgical procedure and is not for everyone, nor is it 100 percent effective. The following techniques each require specialized equipment and personnel trained in the specific procedure being used:\nTENS uses tiny electrical pulses, delivered through the skin to nerve fibers, to cause changes in muscles, such as numbness or contractions. This in turn produces temporary pain relief. There is also evidence that TENS can activate subsets of peripheral nerve fibers that can block pain transmission at the spinal cord level, in much the same way that shaking your hand can reduce pain. Peripheral nerve stimulation uses electrodes placed surgically on a carefully selected area of the body. The patient is then able to deliver an electrical current as needed to the affected area, using an antenna and transmitter. Spinal cord stimulation uses electrodes surgically inserted within the epidural space of the spinal cord. The patient is able to deliver a pulse of electricity to the spinal cord using a small box-like receiver and an antenna taped to the skin. Deep brain or intracerebral stimulation is considered an extreme treatment and involves surgical stimulation of the brain, usually the thalamus. It is used for a limited number of conditions, including severe pain, central pain syndrome, cancer pain, phantom limb pain, and other neuropathic pains.\nExercise has come to be a prescribed part of some doctors' treatment regimes for patients with pain. Because there is a known link between many types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles. Just as we know that stress contributes to pain, we also know that exercise, sleep, and relaxation can all help reduce stress, thereby helping to alleviate pain. Exercise has been proven to help many people with low back pain. It is important, however, that patients carefully follow the routine laid out by their physicians.\nHypnosis, first approved for medical use by the American Medical Association in 1958, continues to grow in popularity, especially as an adjunct to pain medication. In general, hypnosis is used to control physical function or response, that is, the amount of pain an individual can withstand. How hypnosis works is not fully understood. Some believe that hypnosis delivers the patient into a trance-like state, while others feel that the individual is simply better able to concentrate and relax or is more responsive to suggestion. Hypnosis may result in relief of pain by acting on chemicals in the nervous system, slowing impulses. Whether and how hypnosis works involves greater insight-and research-into the mechanisms underlying human consciousness.\nIbuprofen is a member of the aspirin family of analgesics, the so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see below). It is sold over the counter and also comes in prescription-strength preparations.\nLow-power lasers have been used occasionally by some physical therapists as a treatment for pain, but like many other treatments, this method is not without controversy.\nMagnets are increasingly popular with athletes who swear by their effectiveness for the control of sports-related pain and other painful conditions. Usually worn as a collar or wristwatch, the use of magnets as a treatment dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. While it is often dismissed as quackery and pseudoscience by skeptics, proponents offer the theory that magnets may effect changes in cells or body chemistry, thus producing pain relief.\nNarcotics (see Opioids, below).\nNerve blocks employ the use of drugs, chemical agents, or surgical techniques to interrupt the relay of pain messages between specific areas of the body and the brain. There are many different names for the procedure, depending on the technique or agent used. Types of surgical nerve blocks include neurectomy; spinal dorsal, cranial, and trigeminal rhizotomy; and sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix).\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including aspirin and ibuprofen) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic or non-opioid analgesics. They work by reducing inflammatory responses in tissues. Many of these drugs irritate the stomach and for that reason are usually taken with food. Although acetaminophen may have some anti-inflammatory effects, it is generally distinguished from the traditional NSAIDs.\nOpioids are derived from the poppy plant and are among the oldest drugs known to humankind. They include codeine and perhaps the most well-known narcotic of all, morphine. Morphine can be administered in a variety of forms, including a pump for patient self-administration. Opioids have a narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some patients may become physically dependent upon them. For these reasons, patients given opioids should be monitored carefully; in some cases stimulants may be prescribed to counteract the sedative side effects. In addition to drowsiness, other common side effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting.\nPhysical therapy and rehabilitation date back to the ancient practice of using physical techniques and methods, such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation, in the treatment of certain conditions. These may be applied to increase function, control pain, and speed the patient toward full recovery.\nPlacebos offer some individuals pain relief although whether and how they have an effect is mysterious and somewhat controversial. Placebos are inactive substances, such as sugar pills, or harmless procedures, such as saline injections or sham surgeries, generally used in clinical studies as control factors to help determine the efficacy of active treatments. Although placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression sometimes respond well to them. This positive response is known as the placebo effect, which is defined as the observable or measurable change that can occur in patients after administration of a placebo. Some experts believe the effect is psychological and that placebos work because the patients believe or expect them to work. Others say placebos relieve pain by stimulating the brain's own analgesics and setting the body's self-healing forces in motion. A third theory suggests that the act of taking placebos relieves stress and anxiety-which are known to aggravate some painful conditions-and, thus, cause the patients to feel better. Still, placebos are considered controversial because by definition they are inactive and have no actual curative value.\nR.I.C.E. - Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation - are four components prescribed by many orthopedists, coaches, trainers, nurses, and other professionals for temporary muscle or joint conditions, such as sprains or strains. While many common orthopedic problems can be controlled with these four simple steps, especially when combined with over-the-counter pain relievers, more serious conditions may require surgery or physical therapy, including exercise, joint movement or manipulation, and stimulation of muscles.\nSurgery, although not always an option, may be required to relieve pain, especially pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. Surgery may take the form of a nerve block (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix) or it may involve an operation to relieve pain from a ruptured disc. Surgical procedures for back problems include discectomy or, when microsurgical techniques are used, microdiscectomy, in which the entire disc is removed; laminectomy, a procedure in which a surgeon removes only a disc fragment, gaining access by entering through the arched portion of a vertebra; and spinal fusion, a procedure where the entire disc is removed and replaced with a bone graft. In a spinal fusion, the two vertebrae are then fused together. Although the operation can cause the spine to stiffen, resulting in lost flexibility, the procedure serves one critical purpose: protection of the spinal cord. Other operations for pain include rhizotomy, in which a nerve close to the spinal cord is cut, and cordotomy, where bundles of nerves within the spinal cord are severed. Cordotomy is generally used only for the pain of terminal cancer that does not respond to other therapies. Another operation for pain is the dorsal root entry zone operation, or DREZ, in which spinal neurons corresponding to the patient's pain are destroyed surgically. Because surgery can result in scar tissue formation that may cause additional problems, patients are well advised to seek a second opinion before proceeding. Occasionally, surgery is carried out with electrodes that selectively damage neurons in a targeted area of the brain. These procedures rarely result in long-term pain relief, but both physician and patient may decide that the surgical procedure will be effective enough that it justifies the expense and risk. In some cases, the results of an operation are remarkable. For example, many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from surrounding nerves."

Acute aortic syndrome most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This usually occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal part.\nWhen a tear occurs, it creates two channels:\nOne in which blood continues to travel Another where blood stays still\nIf the channel with nontraveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta.

        "output": "In the United States, aortic stenosis often results from calcium deposits on the aortic valve. These deposits occur naturally with age and have no relationship with the amount of calcium in the diet. Approximately 2% of all people have a bicuspid aortic valve, which increases the risk of these calcifications and makes them more likely to develop aortic stenosis. Worldwide, aortic stenosis occurs most commonly in those who've had rheumatic fever, a condition that may develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is increasingly rare in the United States.\nAortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), or it may develop later in life (acquired). Children with aortic stenosis may have other congenital conditions. Radiation treatment to the chest, and some medications may cause aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is not common. It occurs more often in men than in women.\nAs the aortic valve becomes more narrow, the pressure increases inside the lower chamber of the heart (the left ventricle). This causes the left ventricle to become thicker, decreasing blood flow and can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs, and you may feel short of breath. Severe forms of aortic stenosis prevent enough blood from reaching the brain and rest of the body. This can cause lightheadedness and fainting."

        "output": "The aortic valve to malfunction for several reasons. For example, the aortic valve may be abnormal from birth (congenital aortic valve disease), or it could become diseased with age (acquired aortic valve disease).\nThe most common congenital abnormality is a bicuspid aortic valve. As shown below, the aortic valve normally has three leaflets, but a bicuspid aortic valve has only two. It may, therefore, not open or close completely.\nA bicuspid aortic valve is a common abnormality and occurs in 1-2% of people. This is the second most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery. Such valves may function normally for years before becoming stenotic, regurgitant, or both. People with a bicuspid aortic valve require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures but generally no other special precautions are required other than regular follow up with a qualified cardiologist.\nThe most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery is called \"senile aortic calcification,\" meaning that the valve has worn out with age. When a valve becomes worn, the body deposits calcium on it for reasons that are unknown. The calcium restricts or limits the motion of the valve leaflets. This may prevent the valve from opening (causing stenosis) or closing (causing leakage or regurgitation). Less common causes of aortic valve disease include diseases of the aorta, the main blood vessel coming out of the heart and carrying blood to the rest of the body, including ascending aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, and Marfan's syndrome."

        "output": "A failing aortic valve may cause a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain (angina pectoris), and dizziness or loss of consciousness (passing out).\nA narrow valve makes the heart work harder just to pump the blood through the valve to the body. A leaky valve lets blood back into the heart after it has been pumped out. The heart must therefore pump more blood forward to make up for the blood that is leaking backwards. Either way the extra work may cause symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath. Early on the shortness of breath may be noticeable only with exercise. Later, with the progression of valve disease, a patient could experience shortness of breath with even light activity or at rest. Some patients will be unable to sleep flat in bed or may awaken from sleep short of breath. Another sign of heart failure that may occasionally occur is swelling of your feet, particularly prominent later in the afternoon or evening although other conditions, such as varicose veins, can also cause this to occur.\nThe extra work the heart has to perform may also cause chest pain or angina pectoris similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. It may be difficult to tell the difference between heart valve disease and narrowing of the blood vessels to the heart itself (coronary arteries).\nAortic valve disease may also cause dizziness, light headedness or even fainting spells."

        "output": "A number of excellent mechanical replacement valves or prostheses are available today. Most surgeons have a particular preference for one valve over another related to technical factors (how they are sewn into place), however from the patient's point of view there is little if any difference between valves. The principle advantage of mechanical valves is their excellent durability. From a practical standpoint, they do not wear out. The principle disadvantage is that there is a tendency for blood to clot on all mechanical valves. Therefore patients with artificial valves must take anticoagulants or \"blood thinners\" for the rest of their life. There is also a small but definite risk of blood clots causing stroke.\nThere are a variety of natural or biological valves that can be used to replace an abnormal valve. They all share a reduced risk of blood clots forming but all are less durable than mechanical valves. Given enough time, they will probably all wear out. The options in this category include \"xenograft\" valves made from animal tissues (most often pig aortic valves), \"homograft\" or \"allograft\" valves retrieved from human cadavers, and \"pulmonary autograft\" valves moved from the patient's pulmonary artery on the right side of the heart to the aortic position on the left.\nThe decision on the type of valve used should be made in conjunction with your cardiothoracic surgeon and your cardiologist. Ultimately the choice will depend on a patient's preferences, lifestyle, and individual risks as determined by age and other medical conditions."

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "Why Is Surgery Necessary?",
        "output": "The aortic valve is the outflow valve of the left side of the heart, meaning that it opens during systole (when the ventricle contracts or squeezes blood out into the aorta and the rest of the body). When the aortic valve is too narrow or stenotic, the ventricle has to work harder to pump the blood out to the body. This extra work consumes significant energy and ultimately requires extra blood flow to the heart itself. If there is not enough blood flow, the heart becomes ischemic causing anginal chest pain. Aortic stenosis is often progressive, growing worse with time. As the valve gets tighter, the heart has to continue to work harder and harder to keep pumping blood out of the heart. At some point the heart can no longer compensate, resulting in episodes of low blood pressure or hypotension or even syncope. As the heart fails to compensate, fluid will build up in the lungs creating congestion.\nWhen the aortic valve leaks, the heart has to work harder and similar problem occur. The ventricle must pump more blood with each contraction to produce the same forward output, creating a condition called volume overload. The heart can compensate for this volume overload for many months or years provided the leakage develops slowly. Eventually, the heart begins to fail producing shortness of breath and fatigue."

        "output": "Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you fall into a pain-free sleep.\nThere are several different ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Techniques include laparoscopy or endoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery.\nYour surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided. This allows the surgeon to reach your heart and aortic valve. For the endoscopic, or keyhole, approach, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about 1/2 to 3/4 inches) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and aortic valve on the computer. This method is very precise.\nYou will need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries.\nIf your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical: Made of man-made materials, such as titanium or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological: made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nIn some cases, you will have coronary artery bypass surgery, or surgery to replace the first part of the aorta (large blood vessel leaving the heart) at the same time.\nOnce the new valve is working, your surgeon will:\nClose the small cut to your heart or aorta Place catheters (flexible tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up Close the surgical cut in your muscles and skin\nThe surgery may take 3 to 6 hours.\nAortic valve surgery can also be done through a groin artery. No cuts are made on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (tube) with a balloon attached on the end to the valve. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty."

        "output": "Aortic valve surgery is done when the valve does not work properly. Surgery may be done for these reasons:\nChanges in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works. Your heart valve has been damaged by endocarditis (infection of the heart valve).\nA minimally invasive procedure has many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk of infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.\nPercutaneous valvuloplasty is only done in patients who are too sick for major heart surgery. The results of percutaneous valvuloplasty are not long-lasting."

        "input": "What Causes Atrial Fibrillation?",
        "output": "Arrhythmias are caused by a disruption of the normal electrical conduction system of the heart.\nNormally, the four chambers of the heart (two atria and two ventricles) contract in a very specific, coordinated way. The electrial impulse that signals your heart to contract in a synchronized way begins in the sinoatrial node (SA node). This node is your heart's natural pacemaker.\nThe signal leaves the SA node and travels through the two upper chambers (atria). Then the signal passes through another node (the AV node), and finally, through the lower chambers (ventricles). This path enables the chambers to contract in a coordinated fashion.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the atria are stimulated to contract very quickly and differently from the normal pattern. The impulses are sent to the ventricles in an irregular pattern. This makes the ventricles beat abnormally, leading to an irregular (and usually fast) pulse. In atrial flutter, the ventricles may beat very fast, but in a regular pattern. If the atrial fibrillation / flutter is part of a condition called sick sinus syndrome, the sinus node may not work properly and the heart rate may alternate between slow and fast. As a result, there may not be enough blood to meet the needs of the body.\nAtrial fibrillation can affect both men and women. It becomes more common with increasing age.\nCauses of atrial fibrillation include:\nAlcohol abuse (especially binge drinking) Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease (especially after a heart attack or coronary artery bypass surgery) Heart surgery Hypertension Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Medications e.g. porfimer sodium Hyperthyroidism Pericarditis Valvular heart disease (especially mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation)"

As the lungs become more developed, the heart no longer needs to bypass the blood and the opening between atria will close. An atrial septal defect occurs when the opening between the two chambers does not close completely In rare cases, the hole may spontaneously close after birth. Shunting refers to when the blood flows from the left chamber to the right chamber.\nIf too much blood moves from the right side of the heart, pressures in the lungs build up.

        "output": "Small atrial septal defects often cause very few problems and may be found much later in life. Many problems can occur if the shunt is large, however. In advanced and severe cases with large shunts the increased pressure on the right side of the heart would result in reversal of blood flow (now from right to left). This usually results in significant shortness of breath. With a small to moderate atrial septal defect, a person may live a normal life span without symptoms. Larger defects may cause disability by middle age because of increased blood flow and shunting of blood back into the pulmonary circulation. Some patients with ASD may have other congenital heart conditions, such as a leaky valve."

A partial atrioventricular canal defect involves a malformation of the upper two chambers of the heart only. A complete atrioventricular canal defect is a malformation that allows blood to freely circulate amongst all four of the heart's chambers. In both partial and complete defects there is an increased, extra amount of blood that circulates to the lungs.\nComplete atrioventricular canal defect: Signs/symptoms of a complete defect usually present within the first few weeks of life. Common symptoms include:\nPoor appetite Difficulty gaining weight Blue discoloring of the skin (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing/respiratory distress Heart failure (signs include: wheezing, swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet, excessive sweating, sudden gaining of eight, irregular/fast heartbeat)\nPartial atrioventricular canal defect: Signs/symptoms of a partial defect usually are asymptomatic (meaning without symptoms) until much later in life into adulthood.

        "output": "There are two major types of beriberi:\nWet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome affect the nervous system.\nBeriberi is rare in the United States because most foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition, and excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.\nA rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families). People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, because doctors may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.\nBeriberi can occur in breast-fed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.\nGetting dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics raise your risk of beriberi."

        "input": "What causes Bicuspid aortic stenosis?",
        "output": "The aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the aorta. It prevents the blood from flowing back from the aorta into the heart when the pumping chamber relaxes.\nBicuspid aortic valve is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart develops. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common congenital heart disease. It often runs in families.\nThe bicuspid aortic valve may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up as well, causing the heart to have to pump harder than usual to get blood past the valve (aortic stenosis). The aorta may become enlarged with this condition.\nThis condition is more common among males than females.\nA bicuspid aortic valve often exists in babies with coarctation of the aorta and other diseases in which there is a blockage to blood flow on the left side of the heart."

        "output": "Mutations in the SCN5A gene cause Brugada syndrome.\nMutations in the SCN5A gene have been identified in fewer than one-third of people with Brugada syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a sodium channel, which normally transports positively charged sodium atoms (ions) into heart muscle cells. This type of ion channel plays a critical role in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the SCN5A gene alter the structure or function of the channel, which reduces the flow of sodium ions into cells. A disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of Brugada syndrome.\nIn affected people without an identified SCN5A mutation, the cause of Brugada syndrome is often unknown. In some cases, certain drugs may cause a nongenetic (acquired) form of the disorder. Drugs that can induce an altered heart rhythm include medications used to treat some forms of arrhythmia, a condition called angina (which causes chest pain), high blood pressure, depression, and other mental illnesses. Abnormally high blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) or potassium (hyperkalemia), as well as unusually low potassium levels (hypokalemia), also have been associated with acquired Brugada syndrome. In addition to causing a nongenetic form of this disorder, these factors may trigger symptoms in people with an underlying SCN5A mutation."

        "output": "Amyloidosis refers to a family of diseases in which there is a buildup of clumps of proteins called amyloids in body tissues and organs. These proteins slowly replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis that may involve specific organs like the heart (cardiac amlyoidosis), the neurologic system with a peripheral neuropathy or the kidney. Cardiac amyloidosis usually occurs as part of primary amyloidosis (AL type amyloidosis). Primary amyloidosis is often seen in people with multiple myeloma and cancer. Cardiac amyloidosis (\" stiff heart syndrome \") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical form of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical impulses move through the heart (electrical conduction system). This can lead to irregular heart beating also known as arrhythmias and failure of the electrical impulses to conduct through the heart (heart block). Secondary amyloidosis (AA type amyloidosis) rarely affects the heart. However, one form of secondary amyloidosis called senile amyloidosis may involve the heart and blood vessels. Senile amyloidosis is caused by overproduction of a different protein. The condition is becoming more common as the average age of the population increases.\nThere is no difference in the incidence of cardiac amyloidosis between men and women as it affects both genders equally.

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What causes Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?",
        "output": "CPVT is caused by a gene defect (abnormal gene). Genes are part of your DNA, the material passed down from parents to children, which can be passed down through families and inherited in different ways (from either one or both parents). In some cases, CPVT is autosomal dominant which means you need an abnormal gene from only one of your parents to have it. In other cases, CPVT is autosomal recessive which means you need an abnormal gene from both of your parents to get the disease. CPVT can result from mutations in genes such as RYR2 and CASQ2. RYR2 gene mutations cause about half of all cases, while mutations in the CASQ2 gene account for 1 percent to 2 percent of cases. The RYR2 and CASQ2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain a regular heartbeat. For the heart to beat normally, heart muscle cells called myocytes must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Both the RYR2 and CASQ2 proteins are involved in handling calcium within myocytes, which is critical for the regular contraction of these cells. Mutations in either the RYR2 and CASQ2 gene disrupt the handling of calcium within myocytes. During exercise or emotional stress, impaired calcium regulation in the heart can lead to ventricular tachycardia in people with CPVT. Stress and exercise can trigger episodes. Certain medicines, such as catecholamines, can also make it worse."

Any organ or tissue in your chest can be the source of pain, including your heart, lungs, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, or nerves.\nHeart problems that can cause chest pain:\nAngina is a type of heart-related chest pain. This pain occurs because your heart is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breast bone or slightly to the left of it. It may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. The pain may spread to the arm, shoulder, jaw, or back. Heart attack pain can be similar to the pain of unstable angina, but more severe. Aortic dissection causes sudden, severe pain in the chest and upper back. Inflammation or infection in the tissue around the heart (pericarditis) causes pain in the center part of the chest.\nLung problems that can cause chest pain:\nPneumonia, which causes chest pain that usually feels sharp, and often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough A blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism), collapse of a small area of the lung (pneumothorax), or inflammation of the lining around the lung (pleurisy) can cause chest pain that usually feels sharp, and often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough Asthma, which generally also causes shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing\nOther causes of chest pain:\nStrain or inflammation of the muscles and tendons between the ribs Inflammation where the ribs join the breast bone or sternum (costochondritis) Shingles (sharp, tingling pain on one side that stretches from the chest to the back) Anxiety and rapid breathing\nChest pain can also be related to the following digestive system problems:\nHeartburn or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Stomach ulcer (burning pain occurs if your stomach is empty and feels better when you eat food) Gallbladder (pain often gets worse after a meal, especially a fatty meal)\nIn children, most chest pain is not caused by the heart."

        "output": "Claudication is typically caused by peripheral artery disease, a disease in which a person\u2019s arteries in his limbs are damaged. The artery damage is usually caused by atherosclerosis.\nAtheroschlerosis occurs when arteries become blocked by atherosclerotic plaque, which is usually made up of fat and cholesterol. This plaque causes arteries to become rigid and constricted, which can restrict the blood flow through them.\nSince arteries carry oxygen to your muscles, this can be a serious problem. The pain from claudication occurs because not enough oxygen is reaching your muscles."

These are called right-sided heart failure or left-sided heart failure. More often, both sides of the heart are involved.\nHeart failure is present when:\nYour heart muscle cannot pump (eject) the blood out of the heart very well. This is called systolic heart failure.\nYour heart muscles are stiff and do not fill up with blood easily. This is called diastolic heart failure.\nBoth of these problems mean the heart is no longer able to pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of your body, especially when you exercise or are active.\nAs the heart's pumping action is lost, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid builds up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure.\nThe most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.\nHeart failure can also occur when an infection weakens the heart muscle. This condition is called cardiomyopathy.\nOther heart problems that may cause heart failure are:\nCongenital heart disease Heart attack Heart valve disease Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nOther diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:\nEmphysema Overactive thyroid Severe anemia Underactive thyroid"

        "output": "The prognosis of people with heart failure can vary dramatically. The following factors may help the doctor estimate the prognosis.\nThe severity of the symptoms: It is well established that patients who have more severe symptoms of heart failure do not survive as long as those who have mild symptoms. For example, patients with class IV heart failure have the poorest prognosis, while patients with class I have the best.\nHeart function: The ejection fraction of left ventricle (LVEF) is an important indicator of the prognosis. The more severely damaged your heart muscle is, the worse your ejection fraction and worse prognosis will be, regardless of your symptoms.\nThe causes of heart failure: Heart failure associated with alcohol use or pregnancy may spontaneously recover itself over time. Heart failure can be caused by treatable conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, anemia, or vitamin deficiency. The prognosis of these conditions are generally excellent. Heart failure as a result of a valve condition may also be reversible if the valve problem is recognized early and fixed before permanent damage happens. People with heart failure caused by severe hypertension may see considerable improvement of their symptoms when they control their hypertension. But the majority of patients have heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease (CAD) have a worse prognosis and a higher death rate than people who have heart failure that is not a result of CAD.\nHow long you've had heart failure: There is no specific length of time after which your heart function is unlikely to improve. General speaking, the longer you have had heart failure, the poorer prognosis may be even with appropriate treatment.\nCompensatory factors: \"compensatory factors\" are various adjustments to correct the effects of heart failure on other organs. When heart failure occurs, various hormone levels including renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and prostaglandin, may increase. Increases in these hormonal factors and other compensatory factors often make heart failure worse over time."

        "input": "What to expect during coronary artery bypass grafting?",
        "output": "Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) requires a team of experts. A cardiothoracic surgeon does the surgery with support from an anesthesiologist, perfusionist (heart-lung bypass machine specialist), other surgeons, and nurses. There are several types of CABG. They range from traditional surgery in which the chest is opened to reach the heart, to nontraditional surgery in which small incisions (cuts) are made to bypass the blocked or narrowed artery.\nThis type of surgery usually lasts 3 to 5 hours, depending on the number of arteries being bypassed. Numerous steps take place during traditional CABG. You'll be under general anesthesia for the surgery. The term \"anesthesia\" refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep. During the surgery, the anesthesiologist checks your heartbeat, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and breathing. A breathing tube is placed in your lungs through your throat. The tube is connected to a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). An incision is made down the center of your chest. The chest bone is then cut and your ribcage is opened so that the surgeon can get to your heart. Medicines are used to stop your heart, which allows the surgeon to operate on it while it's not beating. You're also given medicines to protect your heart function during the time that it's not beating. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood moving throughout your body during the surgery. An artery or vein is taken from your body\u2014for example, from your chest or leg\u2014and prepared to be used as a graft for the bypass. In surgery with several bypasses, both artery and vein grafts are commonly used.\nArtery grafts. These grafts are much less likely than vein grafts to become blocked over time. The left internal mammary artery most often is used for an artery graft. It's located inside the chest, close to the heart. Arteries from the arm or other places in the body are sometimes used as well.\nVein grafts. Although veins are commonly used as grafts, they're more likely than artery grafts to develop plaque and become blocked over time. The saphenous vein\u2014a long vein running along the inner side of the leg\u2014is typically used.\nAfter the grafting is done, blood flow to your heart is restored. Usually, the heart starts beating again on its own. In some cases, mild electric shocks are used to restart the heart. You're then disconnected from the heart-lung bypass machine. Tubes are inserted into your chest to drain fluid. The surgeon uses wires to close your chest bone (much like how a broken bone is repaired). The wires stay in your body permanently. After your chest bone heals, it will be as strong as it was before the surgery. Stitches or staples are used to close the skin incision. The breathing tube is removed when you're able to breathe without it.\nNontraditional CABG includes off-pump CABG and minimally invasive CABG.\nOff-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: This type of surgery can be used to bypass any of the coronary (heart) arteries. Off-pump CABG also is called beating heart bypass grafting because the heart isn't stopped and a heart-lung bypass machine isn't used. Instead, the part of the heart where grafting is being done is steadied with a mechanical device.\nMinimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting: There are several types of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) grafting. These types of surgery differ from traditional bypass surgery. They only require small incisions rather than opening the chest bone to get to the heart. These procedures sometimes use a heart-lung bypass machine.\nThis procedure is done through small incisions (ports) made in your chest. Artery or vein grafts are used. A heart-lung bypass machine is used during this procedure.\nThis type of procedure allows for even smaller, keyhole-sized incisions. A small video camera is inserted in one incision to show the heart, while the surgeon uses remote-controlled surgical instruments to do the surgery. A heart-lung bypass machine is sometimes used during this procedure."

This is due to inflammation involving the lung and heart sac. This complication sometimes is seen 1 to 6 weeks after surgeries that involve cutting through the pericardium (the outer covering of the heart). This reaction usually is mild. However, some patients may develop fluid buildup around the heart that requires treatment. Memory loss and other changes, such as problems concentrating or thinking clearly, may occur in some people. These changes are more likely to occur in people who are older, who have high blood pressure or lung disease, or who drink excessive amounts of alcohol. These side effects often improve several months after surgery. Use of a heart-lung bypass machine increases the risk of blood clots forming in your blood vessels. Clots can travel to the brain or other parts of the body and block the flow of blood, which may cause a stroke or other problems. Recent technical improvements in heart-lung bypass machines are helping reduce the risk of blood clots forming. In general, the risk of complications is higher if CABG is done in an emergency situation (for example, during a heart attack), if you're older than 70, or if you have a history of smoking. Your risk also is higher if you have other diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, or peripheral arterial disease."

        "output": "After surgery, you'll typically spend 1 or 2 days in an Intensive care unit (ICU). Your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels will be checked regularly during this time. An intravenous line (IV) will likely be inserted into a vein in your arm. Through the IV line, you may get medicines to control blood circulation and blood pressure. You also will likely have a tube in your bladder to drain urine and a tube to drain fluid from your chest. You may receive oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs or a mask) and a temporary pacemaker while in the ICU. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. Your doctor may recommend that you wear compression stockings on your legs as well. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting. While in the ICU, you'll also have bandages on your chest incision (cut) and on the areas where an artery or vein was removed for grafting. After you leave the ICU, you'll be moved to a less intensive care area of the hospital for 3 to 5 days before going home.\nYour doctor will give you specific instructions for recovering at home, especially concerning:\nHow to care for your healing incisions.\nHow to recognize signs of infection or other complications.\nWhen to call the doctor right away.\nWhen to make followup appointments.\nYou also may get instructions on how to deal with common side effects from surgery. Side effects often go away within 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, but may include:\nDiscomfort or itching from healing incisions.\nSwelling of the area where an artery or vein was removed for grafting.\nMuscle pain or tightness in the shoulders and upper back.\nFatigue (tiredness), mood swings, or depression.\nProblems sleeping or loss of appetite.\nConstipation.\nChest pain around the site of the chest bone incision (more frequent with traditional CABG).\nFull recovery from traditional CABG may take 6 to 12 weeks or more. Less recovery time is needed for nontraditional CABG. Your doctor will tell you when you can start physical activity again. It varies from person to person, but there are some typical timeframes. Most people can resume sexual activity within about 4 weeks and driving after 3 to 8 weeks. Returning to work after 6 weeks is common unless your job involves specific and demanding physical activity. Some people may need to find less physically demanding types of work or work a reduced schedule at first.\nCare after surgery may include periodic checkups with doctors. During these visits, tests may be done to see how your heart is working. Tests may include EKG (electrocardiogram), stress testing, echocardiography, and cardiac CT. CABG is not a cure for coronary heart disease (CHD). You and your doctor may develop a treatment plan that includes lifestyle changes to help you stay healthy and reduce the chance of CHD getting worse. Lifestyle changes may include making changes to your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, and lowering and managing stress. Your doctor also may refer you to cardiac rehabilitation (rehab). Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that helps improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. Rehab programs include exercise training, education on heart healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life. Doctors supervise these programs, which may be offered in hospitals and other community facilities. Talk to your doctor about whether cardiac rehab might benefit you. Taking medicines as prescribed also is an important part of care after surgery. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to manage pain during recovery; lower cholesterol and blood pressure; reduce the risk of blood clots forming; manage diabetes; or treat depression."

        "output": "Many things increase your risk for heart disease:\nMen in their 40s have a higher risk of CHD than women. But as women get older (especially after they reach menopause), their risk increases to almost equal that of a man's risk.\nBad genes (heredity) can increase your risk. You are more likely to develop the condition if someone in your family has a history of heart disease -- especially if they had it before age 50. Your risk for CHD goes up the older you get.\nDiabetes is a strong risk factor for heart disease.\nHigh blood pressure increases your risks of coronary artery disease and heart failure.\nAbnormal cholesterol levels: your LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol should be as low as possible, and your HDL (\"good\") cholesterol should be as high as possible to reduce your risk of CHD.\nMetabolic syndrome refers to high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, and increased insulin levels. People with this group of problems have an increased chance of getting heart disease.\nSmokers have a much higher risk of heart disease than nonsmokers.\nChronic kidney disease can increase your risk.\nAlready having atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries in another part of your body (examples are stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm) increases your risk of having coronary heart disease.\nOther risk factors include alcohol abuse, not getting enough exercise, and having excessive amounts of stress.\nHigher-than-normal levels of inflammation-related substances, such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen are being studied as possible indicators of an increased risk for heart disease.\nIncreased levels of a chemical called homocysteine, an amino acid, are also linked to an increased risk of a heart attack."

        "input": "What Procedure to Choose?",
        "output": "Although many indications are the same for performing either PCI or CABG, these two procedures have inherently different mechanisms.  While PCI mitigates an obstruction, it can not prevent plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. On the contrary, CABG is able to prevent future ischemic insults caused by plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. Most studies report the same outcome with PCI and CABG, but there are some reports that favor CABG over PCI: The SYNTAX trial with 705 patients demonstrated a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality rate among those who received PCI than the CABG cohort.  Two Studies reported that CABG is more effective in prevention of late spontaneous MI when compared to PCI.   ACA 2021 revascularization guideline recommends to consider the following factors to decide whether to chose PCI or CABG:  SYNTAX Score  SYNTAX score derived from a clinical trial with the same name which predicts the grade of the anatomic complexity and can be used as a decision-making tool. This score is a guide for selection of a revascularization procedure in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. All cause mortality rate among patients with a coronary artery disease -associated SYNTAX score equal or greater than 33 were significantly lower when undergone CABG than PCI For patients with SYNTAX score lower than 33, no differences have been report in mortality rate of CABG and PCI Compliance to medications Preferences of patient Individual factors, such as anatomic complexity, which is discussed in the following table: \n\n\nPCI would help patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms for less than 12 hours.  Rescue PCI is recommended for STEMI patients who failed re-perfusion after fibrinolytic therapy to improve the survival.    PCI has been related to improved survival rate when done in STEMI patients who are stable and presented 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset.  Regardless of time from MI, PCI can increase survival in STEMI patients who developed complications such as ongoing ischemia, acute sever heart failure, or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.  Performing the PCI is not beneficial in stable and asymptomatic STEMI patients who have a totally occluded infarct artery >24 hours after symptom onset with no evidence for sever ischemia.  The role of PCI in asymptomatic STEMI patients who are presenting after 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset is not well studied.  However, based on a small trial named BRAVE-2 a reduction in left ventricular infarct size has been reported among asymptomatic STEMI patients who were treated with an invasive strategy of coronary stent within 12 to 48 hours after symptom onset, compared to conservative therapies.  Both PCI and CABG are indicated in patients with STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and hemodynamic instability.  CABG is recommended for patients with STEMI who have mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, mitral regurgitation because of papillary muscle infarction or rupture, or free wall rupture.  Emergent or urgent CABG is recommended in STEMI patients whose PCI is not feasible with a large area of myocardial involvement. On the other hand, emergent or urgent CABG should be avoided in these patients in the absence of ischemia or large myocardial involvement. Furthermore, CABG is usually avoided if patients' distal targets are poor.   The following algorithm demonstrates the proper revascularization in STEMI patients. \n\n\nThe sole condition that fibrinolytic therapies are superior to PCI is when the duration from hospital presentation to PCI is anticipated to be more than 120 minutes. An early revascularization strategy could increase the survival rate in patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock.\nFractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are commonly used to assess the lesion significant. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) compares the maximal blood flow distal to the lesion to the normal maximal blood flow. On the other hand iFR compares the instantaneous wave-free ratio of the coronary pressure distal to the lesion during the diastole with the aortic pressure.  Reported in numbers of trials which used FFR, FFR -guided PCI was successful in lowering the revascularization rate, procedure-related chest pain in patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenosis.    In one of these trials patients with abnormal FFR significantly benefited from PCI over medical therapy with lower rate of ischemia -driven revascularization and shorter procedural time.  FFR -guided revascularization with CABG was more off-pump with fewer anastomosis and simpler procedure compared to CABG with angiogram -guided revascularization in one of the clinical trials.    Although other studies reported similar outcomes in both.   iFR measure does not require the administration of adenosine has been also studied in clinical trials. Results supported that this measure is not inferior to FFR and also showed less adverse outcome related to the procedure.  Lower rate of long-term major adverse cardiac events has been reported when PCI was deferred with FFR greater than 0.80 or iFR that is >0.89. One of the trials named DEFER (Deferral of Percutaneous Intervention) reported that the rate of adverse outcome cardiac outcomes is similar in both group of patients whose PCI has been deferred either with a FFR greater than 0.75 or intermediate angiographic measures."

        "output": "Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood. Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nThe blood is sent to a laboratory, where the following are measured:\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol) High density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\" cholesterol) Total cholesterol Triglycerides Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL cholesterol, though this is often calculated from the triglyceride level) Other blood tests, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may be added to the profile in some laboratories."

        "output": "During the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops. Sometimes, for reasons that are unclear, the heart develops and turns so that it points to the right side of the chest instead of the left side. There are several types of dextrocardia. Most involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area. The simplest type of dextrocardia is one in which the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart, and no other problems exist. This condition is rare. Usually in this case, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will also be arranged in a mirror image of their normal position. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right. Some people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages. This condition is called Kartagener syndrome. In the more common types of dextrocardia, heart defects are present in addition to the abnormal location of the heart. The most common heart defects seen with dextrocardia include:\nDouble outlet right ventricle Endocardial cushion defect Pulmonary stenosis or atresia Single ventricle Transposition of the great vessels Ventricular septal defect\nThe abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. Heterotaxy means the organs (atria of the heart and abdominal organs) are not in their usual places. In heterotaxy, the spleen may be completely missing. Because the spleen is an extremely important part of the immune system, babies born without a spleen are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy several small spleens exist, but may not work correctly. Heterotaxy may also include:\nAbnormal gallbladder system Problems with the lungs Problems with the structure of the intestines Severe heart defects\nPossible risk factors for dextrocardia include:\nFamily history of the condition Mother with diabetes (may play a role in some forms of dextrocardia)"

Ebstein's anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. This condition is rare but it is more common among Caucasians. The tricuspid valve is made up of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. These leaflets or flaps allow blood to flow from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. The leaflets close to prevent blood from flowing from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.The leaflets are unusually deep in the right ventricle and are often larger than normal in cases of Ebstein's anomaly. Due to the defect, blood may go the wrong way back into the right atrium, when it should be flowing to the right ventricle. When the blood gets backed up it can lead to heart swelling and fluid buildup in the lungs or liver. Sometimes, blood can't get out of the heart into the lungs and the person may appear blue. However in most cases of Ebstein's anomaly, patients have a hole in the wall which separates the heart's two upper chambers and the blood may flow across the hole. This may cause oxygen -poor blood to go to the rest of the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve)."

Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include:\nAtrioventricular canal defect Atrial septal defect Cyanotic heart disease Patent ductus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus\nOver time, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Instead, the blood goes from the right side to the left side of the heart, allowing oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body.

Most people who develop infectious endocarditis have underlying heart disease or valve problems. However, an organism commonly found in the mouth, Streptococcus viridans, is responsible for about 50% of all bacterial endocarditis cases. This is why dental procedures increase your chances for developing this condition. Such procedures are especially risky for children with congenital heart conditions. As a result, it is common practice for children with some forms of congenital heart disease and adults with certain heart-valve conditions to take antibiotics before any dental work. Other common culprits include Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus. Staphylococcus aureus can infect normal heart valves, and is the most common cause of infectious endocarditis in intravenous drug users.

        "input": "What if you factor in the reduction in costly strokes and the reduction in costs due to a reduction in bleeding?",
        "output": "If complications of pharmacotherapy are included in the cost effectiveness analysis, the cost effectiveness of dabigatran may be even more favorable.\nThe lifetime cost of all cause stroke is estimated by the CDC to be $100,000. The rate of stroke per year was 1.57% for Warfarin and 1.01% for 150 mg of dabigatran. Therefore, there is a 0.56% lower rate of stroke per year. In our population of 200 patients, there would be expected to be 1.12 fewer strokes. If each stroke costs $100,000 over the lifetime of the patient then preventing 1.12 fewer cases with dabigatran would save $112,000.\nIn addition to the small but statistically significant reduction in mortality associated with Dabigatran therapy, there were also numerically (but not statistically significantly) fewer major bleeds (3.4% vs 3.1% per year). The cost of a major bleed is estimated to be $8000 (personal communication, Dr. David Cohen). The cost of treating 200 patients with dabigatran would be reduced slightly by 0.6 bleeds or $4,800 dollars.\nThere was an increased risk of MI of 0.21% (p=0.048) for dabigatran vs Warfarin (0.74% - 0.53%/year). The cost of a significant q wave MI is $7000 (Source: Dr. David Cohen). Treatment of the 200 patients with dabigatran would yield 0.4 of an MI at an increased cost of $2800.\nTreating 200 patients with dabigatran for a year costs an additional $224,600 over Warfarin. Among 200 treated patients, there is a cost reduction of $112,000 due to 1.12 fewer stroke cases with dabigatran. Among these 200 treated patients, there is a cost reduction of $4,800 due to 0.6 fewer major bleeds. There is also a cost increase of $2,800 among these 200 treated patients due to 0.4 MI cases. The total additional cost of dabigatran treatment inclusive of complications in 200 patients is $110,600. The cost per year of life saved assuming 6.75 years of survival could therefore be as low as $16,385.\nIf society views $50,000 / year of life saved as cost effective, and' if it costs society $110,600 to save that life when the costs of complications are factored in, then' the survival of atrial fibrillation patients must only exceed 2.2 years for the therapy to be cost effective. (Spending $110,600 to save a life of someone who lives 2.2. years equates to $50,000 per year of life saved.) Most 71 year old atrial fibrillation patients survive more than 2.2 years."

        "output": "There was a reduction in all cause stroke from 1.57% / year for Warfarin to 1.01% / year for dabigatran, a 0.56% / year reduction. You would need to treat 179 patients with dabigatran to prevent one stroke. This would incur an incremental cost of 179 x $1,123, or $200,535. On the other hand, the lifetime cost of all cause stroke is estimated by the CDC to be $100,000. The net total cost would therefore be $100,535. Patients with stroke have a 2.3 fold higher mortality, so survival was estimated to be 13.5 / 2.3 = 5.8 years. That\u2019s $17,333 per year of stroke-free life saved."

The judgment of our health economists is that somewhere in the region of 20,000-30,000 GBP per quality-adjusted life year is the threshold, but it's not a strict limit. \u201c\nThis would convert to 1.58 X 20,000 GBP = $31,600 USD to $47,400 USD.

        "output": "Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired) either from a disease, medication or surgery.\nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\nIn pregnant patients, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medications - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medications for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your bdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\nIn some cases, acquired heart blockmay go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\nAlso, if a medication is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medication is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medications."

These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nHeredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.\nAcquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the disorder are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.\nPeople who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are more likely to have heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases).\nOther diseases also may raise the risk of heart block. These include sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\nExposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk of heart block.\nWell-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve.

If you have second-degree heart block that doesn't require a pacemaker, talk with your doctor about keeping your heart healthy. Your doctor will tell you whether you need ongoing care for your condition. People who have third-degree heart block and some people who have second-degree heart block need pacemakers. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. If you have a pacemaker, you should take special care to avoid things that may interfere with it. Avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices and devices that have strong magnetic fields. These objects can keep your pacemaker from working properly. Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker. You also should notify airport screeners. Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have. Carry this card in your wallet. You may want to consider wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker. Certain medical procedures can disrupt pacemakers. Examples include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocauterization during surgery, and shockwave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones. Your doctor may need to check your pacemaker several times a year to make sure it is working well. Some pacemakers must be checked in the doctor's office, but others can be checked over the phone. Ask your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. A pacemaker usually would not limit you from doing sports and physical activity.

        "input": "What is the Outlook/Prognosis?",
        "output": "You should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body's immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor's instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\nYou must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.\nYou can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.\nTo make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you will have cardiac catheterization every year.\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years."

High fructose (sugar)corn syrup Metabolic syndrome -in which body develops insulin resistance due to obesity and has high blood pressure, sugar,cholesterol and increased waist circumference.\nSecondary hypertension by definition results from an identifiable cause. This type is important to recognize since it's treated differently than essential hypertension, by treating the underlying cause of the elevated blood pressure. Hypertension results compromise or imbalance of the pathophysiological mechanisms, such as the hormone-regulating endocrine system, that regulate blood plasma volume and heart function. Many conditions cause hypertension, some are common and well recognized secondary causes such as\nRenovascular Hypertension: Due to fibromuscular dysplasia and renal artery stenosis. In both conditiions, increased blood pressure occurs due to narrowing of arteries supplying to the kidney. Pheochromocytoma: Caused by an excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome): Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, Liddle's syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism), glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism Cushing's syndrome - an excessive secretion of glucocorticoids causes the hypertension Hyperparathyroidism Acromegaly Hyperthyroidism Hypothyroidism Chronic Kidney disease Coarctation of Aorta Drugs: Oral Contraceptives, steroids, NSAIDs, nasal decongestants with adrenergic effects, MAOIs, adrenoceptor stimulants. Scleroderma Neurofibromatosis Pregnancy -unclear mechanism Obstructive sleep apnea Fever: unclear etiology Liquorice White coat hypertension: that is, elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but not in other settings, probably due to the anxiety some people experience during a clinic visit. Perioperative hypertension is development of hypertension just before, during or after surgery. It may occur before surgery during the induction of anesthesia; intraoperatively e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic nervous system stimulation; in the early postanesthesia period, e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic stimulation, hypothermia, hypoxia, or hypervolemia from excessive intraoperative fluid therapy; and in the 24 to 48 hours after the postoperativ period as fluid is mobilized from the extravascular space.

These symptoms may include:\nBluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color Cold hands and feet (extremities) Lethargy Poor pulse Poor suckling and feeding Pounding heart Rapid breathing Shortness of breath\nIn healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis).\nHowever, a bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying."

        "input": "What causes Hypoplastic left heart syndrome?",
        "output": "Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when there is not enough growth of the left ventricle and other structures, including the:\nAorta - the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body Entrance and exit of the ventricle Mitral and aortic valves\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be incompletely developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections:\nForamen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium) Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vesel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using heart catheterization."

This type of hypotension usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes. If this type of hypotension occurs after eating, it is called postprandial orthostatic hypotension. This form most commonly affects older adults, those with high blood pressure, and persons with Parkinson's disease. NMH most often affects young adults and children. It occurs when a person has been standing for a long time. Children usually outgrow this type of hypotension. Low blood pressure is commonly caused by drugs such as: Alcohol Anti-anxiety medications Certain antidepressants Diuretics Heart medicines, including those used to treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease Medications used for surgery Painkillers Other causes of low blood pressure include: Advanced diabetes Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic response) Changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmias) Dehydration Fainting"

        "output": "It's important to know the symptoms of Lyme disease and to seek medical help if you think have Lyme disease. Early signs and symptoms (3 to 30 days after tick bite): The first symptom is usually a red rash at the site of tick bite, which may look like a bullseye, but not all people with Lyme disease have a rash. The rash is called erythema chronicum migrans or erythema migrans (EM). EM occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected persons. EM begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days (average is about 7 days). EM expands gradually over a period of days reaching up to 12 inches or more (30 cm) across. EM may feel warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful. Sometimes, EM clears as it enlarges, resulting in a target or bullseye appearance. EM may appear on any area of the body but is usually present on areas including the axilla, inguinal region, popliteal fossa, or along belt line. The rash may or may not be associated with flu-like symptoms including: Fever and/or chills Headache Body aches Joint aches Stiff neck Fatigue Classic Lyme disease rash - Source: CDC.gov\nLate Signs and Symptoms (days to months after tick bite): Severe headaches and neck stiffness Multiple erythema migrans rashes on other areas of the body. Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, particularly of the knees and other large joints. Facial palsy (loss of muscle tone or droop on one or both sides of the face). Intermittent pain in tendons, muscles, joints, and bones. Heart palpitations or an irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis). Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Nerve pain. Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet. Problems with short-term memory.\nNotes Fever and other flu-like symptoms may occur in the absence of rash. A small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that occurs immediately and resembles a mosquito bite, is common. This irritation generally goes away in 1-2 days and is not a sign of Lyme disease. A rash with a very similar appearance to EM occurs with Southern Tick-associated Rash Illness (STARI), but is not Lyme disease. Ticks can spread other organisms that may cause a different type of rash. What Causes Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacterial infection you get from bite of an infected tick. The majority of Lyme disease in North America is caused by bite of black-legged tick, or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Other ticks that transmit Lyme disease are the sheep tick, castor bean tick, or European castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) in the Europe, the Western black legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in the Pacific region of North America, and the taiga tick (Ixodes persulactus) in Europe, Central and Northern Asia, China, and Japan. Only 20% of individuals infected with Lyme disease by the deer tick are aware of having had any tick bite.

Individuals with outdoor occupations and who work outside with bare or exposed skin are at a high risk of contracting Lyme disease. Failing to remove a tick as soon as you see it on your skin (the longer a tick is attached to your skin, the greater your risk of developing Lyme disease) also increases risk of developing Lyme disease.\nEndemic Regions: About 95% of all reported cases are confined to 14 states including Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Any individual traveling or living within these five geographic areas including New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central is at a heightened risk of exposure to Lyme disease.\nSeasonal Variation: The majority of Lyme disease cases are reported during the summer months of May to August. Case incidence increases in May, peaks in June and July, and tapers off in August.\nRarer forms of Transmission: Cases of blood transfusion and organ transplantation have been recorded as methods of transmission but transmission through this avenue is rare."

        "input": "What causes Mitral regurgitation?",
        "output": "Regurgitation means leaking from a valve that doesn't close all the way. It is caused by diseases that weaken or damage the valve or its supporting structures. Mitral regurgitation becomes chronic when the condition persists rather than occurring for only a short time period. Chronic mitral regurgitation should be distinguished from acute mitral regurgitation.\nIn acute mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close all the way and blood flows backward into the left upper heart chamber (atrium). This leads to a decrease in blood flow to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder.\nAcute mitral regurgitation may be caused by dysfunction or injury to the valve following a heart attack or infection of the heart valve (infective endocarditis). These conditions may rupture the valve or surrounding structures, leaving an opening for blood to move backwards.\nMitral valve prolapse is a relatively common cause of chronic mitral regurgitation.\nAbout one-third of all cases of chronic mitral regurgitation are caused by rheumatic heart disease, a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common.\nCongenital (present from birth) mitral regurgitation is rare if it is not part of a more complex heart defect or syndrome.\nChronic mitral regurgitation can also be caused by:\nAtherosclerosis Endocarditis Heart tumors High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Swelling of the left lower heart chamber Untreated syphilis (rare)\nRisk factors include an individual or family history of any of the disorders mentioned above and use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine (appetite suppressants banned by the FDA) for 4 or more months."

As much as 10% of the population has some minor, insignificant form of mitral valve prolapse, but it does not generally affect their lifestyle.\nIn a small number of cases, the prolapse can cause blood to leak backwards. This is called mitral regurgitation.\nMitral valves that are structurally abnormal can raise the risk for bacterial infection.\nSome forms of mitral valve prolapse seem to be passed down through families (inherited). Mitral valve prolapse has been associated with Graves disease.\nMitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders.\nMitral valve prolapse is associated with some connective tissue disorders, especially Marfan syndrome.

        "input": "How is Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive) done?",
        "output": "Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain.\nThere are several different ways to perform minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.\nYour heart surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch-long cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided so your surgeon can reach the heart. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so the surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve. In endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about \u00c2\u00bd to \u00c2\u00be inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and mitral valve on the computer. This method is very precise.\nYou may or may not need to be on a heart lung machine for these types of surgery, but if not, your heart rate will be slowed by medicine or a mechanical device.\nIf your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have:\nRing annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or both of the leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve.\nIf your mitral valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical -- made of man-made materials, such as titanium, or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 - 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nThe surgery may take 2 -4 hours.\nThis surgery can also be done through a groin artery, with no cuts on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (flexible tube) with a balloon attached on the end. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty."

        "output": "You may need surgery if your mitral valve does not work properly because:\nYou have mitral regurgitation -- a mitral valve that does not close all the way and allows blood to leak back into the left atria. You have mitral stenosis -- a mitral valve that does not open fully and restricts blood flow. Your valve has developed an infection (infectious endocarditis) You have severe mitral valve prolapse that is not controlled with medications.\nMinimally invasive surgery may be done for these reasons:\nChanges in your mitral valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that the changes in your mitral valve are beginning to seriously affect your heart function. Your heart valve has been damaged by infection (endocarditis).\nA minimally invasive procedure has many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk of infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.\nPercutaneous valvoplasty is a procedure that is only done in people who are too sick to have anesthesia. The results of this procedure are not long lasting."

If the infection affects your heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. However, the chemicals produced by an immune response can damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak. This leads to symptoms of heart failure.\nOther causes of myocarditis may include:\nAllergic reactions to certain medications or toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs, heavy metals, and catecholamines) Being around certain chemicals Certain diseases that cause inflammation throughout the body (rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis)"

They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.\nOther factors that affect weight include:\nThe way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active: Many people do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. People with less free time have less time to exercise.\nThe term \"eating disorder\" means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.\nSometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:\nUnderactive thyroid gland hypothyroidism Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics\nOther things that can cause weight gain are:\nQuitting smoking. Most people who quit smoking gain 4 - 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting. Some people gain as much as 25 - 30 pounds.

        "input": "Who needs Percutaneous coronary intervention?",
        "output": "Percutaneous coronary intervention is used to restore blood flow to the heart when the coronary (heart) arteries have become narrowed or blocked because of coronary heart disease (CHD).\nPercutaneous coronary intervention is one of a number of treatments for CHD. Other treatments include medicines and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Your doctor will consider many factors when deciding what treatment or combination of treatments to recommend.\nCompared with CABG, some advantages of percutaneous coronary intervention are that it:\nDoesn't require an incision (cut) Doesn't require general anesthesia (that is, you won't be temporarily put to sleep during the procedure) Has a shorter recovery time\nPercutaneous coronary intervention also is used as an emergency procedure during a heart attack. As plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, it can rupture. This can cause a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface and block blood flow. The lack of oxygen-rich blood to the heart can damage the heart muscle.\nQuickly opening a blockage lessens the damage during a heart attack by restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. Percutaneous coronary intervention usually is the fastest way to open a blocked artery and is the best approach during a heart attack.\nA disadvantage of percutaneous coronary intervention, when compared with CABG, is that the artery more frequently renarrows over time. However, the risk of this happening is lower when stents are used, especially stents coated with medicines (drug-eluting stents).\nStents are small mesh tubes that support the inner artery wall. They reduce the chance of the artery becoming narrowed or blocked again. Some stents are coated with medicines that are slowly and continuously released into the artery. The medicines help prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. However, stents aren't without risks. In some cases, blood clots can form in stents and cause a heart attack.\nYour doctor will talk to you about your treatment options and which procedure is best for you."

        "output": "Before the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure begins, you will be given some pain medicine. You may also be given blood thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming.\nYou will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube (catheter) through a surgical cut into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist. You will be awake during the procedure.\nThe doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Dye will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.\nA guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart.\nA wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.\nThe stent may be coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future. However, drug-eluting stents are slightly more likely to close in the short-term. Currently, they are only used for certain patients."

However, they can happen no matter how careful your doctor is or how well he or she does the procedure.\nSerious complications include:\nBleeding from the blood vessel where the catheters were inserted. Blood vessel damage from the catheters. An allergic reaction to the dye given during the percutaneous coronary intervention. An arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). The need for emergency coronary bypass surgery during the procedure (2\u20134 percent of people). This may occur if an artery closes down instead of opening up. Damage to the kidneys caused by the dye used. Heart attack (3\u20135 percent of people). Stroke (less than 1 percent of people).\nSometimes chest pain can occur during percutaneous coronary intervention because the balloon briefly blocks blood supply to the heart.\nAs with any procedure involving the heart, complications can sometimes, though rarely, cause death. Less than 2 percent of people die during percutaneous coronary intervention.\nComplications from stents include:\nAfter percutaneous coronary intervention, the treated coronary artery can become narrowed or blocked again, often within 6 months of percutaneous coronary intervention. This is called restenosis.\nStudies suggest that there's a higher risk of blood clots forming in medicine-coated stents compared to bare metal stents. However, no conclusive evidence shows that these stents increase the chances of having a heart attack or dying, if used as recommended.\nThe risk of complications is higher in:\nPeople aged 75 and older People who have kidney disease or diabetes Women People who have poor pumping function in their hearts People who have extensive heart disease and blockages in their coronary (heart) arteries"

Often you have to stop eating and drinking by midnight the night before the procedure. What medicines you should and shouldn't take on the day of the percutaneous coronary intervention. When to arrive at the hospital and where to go.\nEven though percutaneous coronary intervention takes only 1 to 2 hours, you'll likely need to stay in the hospital overnight or longer.

They also will check your arm or groin for bleeding. After a few hours, you'll be able to walk with help.\nThe place where the catheters (tubes) were inserted may feel sore or tender for about a week.\nGoing Home:\nMost people go home the day after the procedure. When your doctor thinks you're ready to leave the hospital, you'll get instructions to follow at home, such as:\nHow much activity or exercise you can do. When you should follow up with your doctor. What medicines you should take. What you should look for daily when checking for signs of infection around the area where the tube was inserted. Signs of infection may include redness, swelling, or drainage. When you should call your doctor. For example, you may need to call if you have shortness of breath; a fever; or signs of infection, pain, or bleeding where the tubes were inserted. When you should call 9\u20131\u20131 (for example, if you have any chest pain).\nYour doctor will prescribe medicine to prevent blood clots from forming after the procedure such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) or prasugrel (Efient). Taking your medicine as directed is very important. If you got a stent during percutaneous coronary intervention, the medicine reduces the risk that blood clots will form in the stent. Blood clots in the stent can block blood flow and cause a heart attack.\nDO NOT STOP TAKING THEM WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. Stopping these medications too soon can be life-threatening.\nRecovery and Recuperation:\nMost people recover from percutaneous coronary intervention and return to work about 1 week after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check your progress after you leave the hospital. During the follow-up visit, your doctor will examine you, make changes to your medicines (if needed), do any necessary tests, and check your overall recovery.\nUse this time to ask questions you may have about activities, medicines, or lifestyle changes, or to talk about any other issues that concern you.\nLifestyle Changes:\nAlthough percutaneous coronary intervention can reduce the symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD), it isn't a cure for CHD or the risk factors that led to it. Making healthy lifestyle changes can help treat CHD and maintain the good results from percutaneous coronary intervention.\nTalk with your doctor about your risk factors for CHD and the lifestyle changes you'll need to make. For some people, these changes may be the only treatment needed.\nLifestyle changes may include changing your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing stress. You also should take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes."

Further more, the doctor can measure the speed of blood flow by echocardiogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray image of chest allows the doctor to check the size and shape of your great vessles and heart. Chest CT or MRI: A chest CT or MRI can demonstrate the details of the heart extremely well, such as the great vessles, vascular, atrial and ventricular structures and their relationships to one another. Cardiac catheterization: This is not a common diagnostic measure for persistent left superior vena cava. In a catheter room, the doctor threads a thin tube through a blood vessel in the patient's arm or groin to an artery in the heart and injects dye to see great vessles, atria and ventricles on an x-ray.

Coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart muscle) come out of the aorta just above the valve at the entrance of the aorta.\nIn truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles. There is usually also a large hole between the two ventricles (ventricular septal defect). As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix.\nSome of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, some goes to the coronary arteries, and the rest goes to the body. Usually, too much blood is sent to the lungs.\nIf this condition is not treated, two problems occur:\nToo much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them, making it difficult to breathe. The blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged. Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood to them. This is called pulmonary hypertension and it can be life-threatening."

Lung damage with a buildup of body fluid is also seen in kidney failure. Exercising at very high altitudes can also cause pulmonary edema.\nPulmonary edema may also be a complication of a heart attack, leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves), or any disease of the heart that results in weakening or stiffening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)."

When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lung become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, the right side of the heart may become enlarged. At some point, not enough blood flows to the lungs to pick up oxygen and symptoms begin. At this point, heart failure that involves the right side of the heart is present. This is called cor pulmonale.\nPumonary hypertension may be caused by:\nAny condition that causes chronic low oxygen levels in the blood Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Certain birth defects of the heart Certain diet medications Congestive heart failure History of a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) HIV infection Lung or heart valve disease Obstructive sleep apnea\nIn many cases the cause is unknown, in which case the condition is known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).

This is followed by a loud snort and gasp, and the snoring returns. This pattern repeats frequently throughout the night.\nThe main symptoms of OSA are usually associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, including falling asleep at inappropriate times. Most people also report awakening unrefreshed in the morning.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDepression Memory difficulties Morning headaches Personality changes Poor concentration Restless and fitful sleep Frequent waking up during the night to urinate Insomnia\nIt is not uncommon for children with OSA to display hyperactive behavior.

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",

        "output": "OSA is caused by the relaxation of the muscles of the back of the throat, which then impede airflow. Normally, the muscles of the upper part of the throat help keep the airway open and allow air to flow into the lungs. Even though these muscles usually relax during sleep, the upper throat should remain open wide enough to let air pass through unobstructed.\nSeveral factors may affect the width of the throat area, and can therefore contribute to the obstruction of the airway. Having a narrower throat area can affect the ease with which air can pass through the airways. When the muscles in the narrower upper throat relax during sleep, the airway may completely close. This prevents air from getting into the lungs and loud snoring and labored breathing occur. During deep sleep, breathing can stop for a period of time (often more than 10 seconds). This is called apnea."

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 40 percent of adult men and 24 percent of adult women are considered habitual snorers , and snoring is often associated with sleep apnea.\nMetabolic Syndrome and Sleep Apnea:\nObesity: Obesity has been closely linked to OSA  in part because the extra fat around the neck can narrow the opening of the windpipe. Older obese men seem to be at higher risk since up to 40 percent of morbidly obese men in a clinical population are affected by OSA . Though it is hardly the only factor that has an effect, weight loss can alleviate some of the symptoms of OSA; losing 10 percent of body weight can reduce the number of apnea episodes throughout the night. \nDiabetes: Diabetes has also been associated with OSA independently from obesity. Studies have shown that both obese and slender people with diabetes have reported difficulty breathing while sleeping . The causal relationship, however, has not yet been established.\nHypertension: There is a definite link between hypertension and OSA. One out of every 2 people who have OSA are diagnosed with high blood pressure . The relationship between hypertension and OSA is also independent from other risk factors, including obesity.\nOther risk factors: The following factors may also increase your risk for obstructive sleep apnea:\nCertain shapes of the palate and jaw Large tonsils and adenoids in children Large neck or collar size Large tongue Narrow airway Nasal obstruction\nIn addition to these risk factors, drinking alcohol or using sedatives before sleep may exacerbate the condition and increase the likelihood of an episode of apnea.\nHaving a neck size over 17 inches for men and 16 inches for women is also a risk factor for sleep apnea. Moreover, having a deviated septum would cause a nasal obstruction that could lead to sleep apnea ."

        "output": "Stroke is the emergence condition of brain. There are two types of stroke: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurs when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow. While hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. About 80 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Clinical studies show that the common risk factors of stroke are hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking. According to The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), five major signs of stroke are five \u201csudden\u201d: sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\uff0c sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, sudden severe headache with no known cause. Nervous system physical examination and head images may help diagnose. Treatment of ischemic stroke includes anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants, and carotid endarterectomy. For patients with hemorrhagic stroke, surgery may be recommended to treat these disorders or prevent another one. Rehabilitation is needed for patients to recover the functions lost. The prognosis of stroke depends on the location and area the brain damage, the time from onset to emergence department, the complications and the treatment effect of the rehabilitation. Measurements such as keep a healthy lifestyle, control hypertension and diabetes may decrease your risk of stroke."

        "input": "What causes Heart block?",
        "output": "Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).\nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\nIn pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicines - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\nIn some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."

        "output": "Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a medical condition in which the nerve impulse generated in the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atrium of the heart can not propagate to the ventricles.\nMany conditions can cause third-degree heart block, but the most common cause is coronary ischemia. Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block. This may be preceded by first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, or bifascicular block. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block.\nAn inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block. In this case, the damage is usually transitory. Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks. The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm.\nAn anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm.\nThird-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown. Studies suggest that the prevalence of congenital third-degree heart block is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 22,000 live births.\nHyperkalemia in those with previous cardiac disease and Lyme disease can also result in third-degree heart block."

The symptoms of TIAs do not last as long the symptoms of a stroke. TIAs also do not show changes to the brain on CT or MRI scans. (Strokes usually show changes on such tests.)\nThe temporary loss of blood flow to the brain can be caused by:\nA blood clot within an artery of the brain A blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, the heart) An injury to blood vessels Narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain\nFor instance, the temporary disruption in blood flow could be due to a blood clot that occurs and then dissolves. The blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves.\nLess common causes of TIA include:\nAn irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation Certain blood disorders, including polycythemia, sickle cell anemia, and syndromes where the blood is very thick Conditions that cause blood vessels problems such as fibromuscular dysplasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and syphilis Inflammation of the arteries such as arteritis, polyarteritis, and granulomatous angiitis Spasm of the small arteries in the brain\nAtherosclerosis (\"hardening of the arteries\") is a condition where fatty deposits occur on the inner lining of the arteries.

This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. Low blood oxygen leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin) and shortness of breath. In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen. The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body. In transposition of the great vessels, the blood goes to the lungs, picks up oxygen, and then goes right back to the lungs without ever going to the body. Blood from the body returns to the heart and goes back to the body without ever picking up oxygen in the lungs. Symptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward. How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of heart defects (such as atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much oxygen moves through the body's general blood flow.\nThe condition is the second most common cyanotic heart defect."

If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains. This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD.\nVentricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital heart defects. The baby may have no symptoms, and the hole can eventually close as the wall continues to grow after birth. If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs, leading to heart failure. The cause of VSD is not yet known. This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects.\nIn adults, ventricular septal defects are a rare but serious complication of heart attacks.

        "output": "The vertebrobasilar system is also called the back (posterior) circulation of the brain. Three main blood vessels provide blood flow to the back of the brain:\nOne basilar artery Two vertebral arteries\nThe back of the brain contains structures that are crucial for keeping a person alive. For instance, the brainstem controls breathing and swallowing, among other things. Parts of the brain help with vision (occipital lobes) and movement coordination (cerebellus) are also located in the back of the brain.\nMany different conditions may cause blood flow in the back part of the brain to be reduced or stopped. The most common cause is a stroke due to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\nVertebrobasilar vascular disorders may also be caused if a tear (dissection) in an artery wall leads to the release of a clot that blocks blood flow. Dissection can be caused by clogged arteries, conditions such as fibromuscular dysplasia, or injuries such a car accident. It may even be caused by manipulations of the neck by a chiropractor, or during massage. However, most of the time, no apparent cause of dissection can be identified. When vertebrobasilar disease is present in a younger person, dissection of one of the arteries is often the cause.\nOther less common causes of vertebrobasilar vascular disorders include connective tissue diseases and vasculitis."

        "output": "Acne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin, called pores, become clogged.\nEach pore is an opening to a follicle, which contains a hair and an oil gland. These oil glands help lubricate the skin and help remove old skin cells. When glands produce too much oil, the pores can become blocked. Dirt, debris, bacteria, and inflammatory cells build up. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. The top of the plug may be white (whitehead) or dark (blackhead). If the plug breaks open, the material inside causes swelling and red bumps to form. If the inflammation is deep in your skin, the pimples may enlarge to form firm, painful cysts.\nAcne is a problem of swelling and inflammation, not a problem caused by bacteria.\nAcne tends to run in families and can be triggered by:\nHormonal changes related to menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, or stress Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products Certain drugs (such as steroids, testosterone, estrogen, and phenytoin) High levels of humidity and sweating\nDespite the popular belief that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne, research does not confirm this idea.

Scrubbing the skin does not stop acne. It can even make the problem worse. Try not to touch your skin: People who squeeze, pinch, or pick their pimples can get scars or dark spots on their skin. Shave carefully: If you shave, you can try both electric and safety razors to see which works best. With safety razors, use a sharp blade. Also, it helps to soften your beard with soap and water before putting on shaving cream. Shave lightly and only when you have to. Stay out of the sun: Many acne medicines can make people more likely to sunburn. Being in the sun a lot can also make skin wrinkle and raise the risk of skin cancer. Choose makeup carefully: All makeup should be oil free. Look for the word noncomedogenic on the label. This means that the makeup will not clog up your pores.

However, research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop skin cancer. The following are risk factors for skin cancer:\nUltraviolet (UV) Radiation\nUV radiation comes from the sun, sunlamps, tanning beds, or tanning booths. A person's risk of skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation. Most skin cancer appears after age 50, but the sun damages the skin from an early age. UV radiation affects everyone. But people who have fair skin that freckles or burns easily are at greater risk. These people often also have red or blond hair and light -colored eyes. But even people who tan can get skin cancer. People who live in areas that get high levels of UV radiation have a higher risk of skin cancer. In the United States, areas in the south (such as Texas and Florida) get more UV radiation than areas in the north (such as Minnesota).

        "output": "The exact cause of Beh\u00e7et's disease is unknown. Most symptoms of the disease are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels. Inflammation is a characteristic reaction of the body to injury or disease and is marked by four signs: swelling, redness, heat, and pain. Doctors think that an autoinflammatory reaction may cause the blood vessels to become inflamed, but they do not know what triggers this reaction. Under normal conditions, the immune system protects the body from diseases and infections by killing harmful \"foreign\" substances, such as germs, that enter the body. In an autoimmune reaction, the immune system mistakenly attacks and harms the body's own tissues.\nBeh\u00e7et's disease is not contagious; it is not spread from one person to another. Researchers think that two factors are important for a person to get Beh\u00e7et's disease. First, it is believed that abnormalities of the immune system make some people susceptible to the disease. Scientists think that this susceptibility may be inherited; that is, it may be due to one or more specific genes. Second, something in the environment, possibly a bacterium or virus, might trigger or activate the disease in susceptible people."

While most reactions occur at temperatures 40\u00b0 F or lower, many people often experience worse reactions as their exposed skin is rewarming. Cold urticaria is more likely to occur when conditions are damp and windy. Cold urticaria symptoms vary in intensity. While some individuals only experience very minor reactions to cold, other individuals experience severe reactions. There is no exact timeframe over which cold urticaria can be said to go away. For some people, it will go away on its own after several months; however, other people may experience cold urticaria for years before seeing an improvement.\nSome signs and symptoms of cold urticaria include:\nHives that are red and itchy. These hives result from exposing the skin to cold and typically last for half an hour Swelling of the hands when holding cold objects Swelling of the lips when eating cold foods In severe cases, the tongue and throat may swelland inhibit breathing\nWhile some symptoms may only affect certain parts of the body, other people may experience symptoms that affect their whole body. Some of the more serious signs and symptoms of cold urticaria include:\nFainting Chills A faster than normal heartbeat Swelling of the arms, legs or torso\nSevere reactions Exposure to cold can be dangerous for people who suffer from cold urticaria. It is especially dangerous when individuals swim in cold water since swimming exposes all of the individual\u2019s skin to the cold. When this level of exposure occurs, the body releases high levels of histamine and other immune system chemicals. As a result of the release of all these chemicals, the individual\u2019s blood pressure can drop, which may result in fainting, shock, and rarely, death. Individuals who suffer from cold urticaria and who choose to swim in cold water may lose consciousness as a result of the cold, which may lead to drowning."

        "output": "The incubation period is 2\u20135 days (range: 1\u201310 days). Affected anatomic sites include the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx, tonsils, larynx, and trachea respiratory diphtheria), skin (cutaneous diphtheria), or rarely, mucous membranes at other sites (eye, ear, vulva). Nasal diphtheria can be asymptomatic or mild, with a blood-tinged discharge. Respiratory diphtheria has a gradual onset and is characterized by a mild fever (rarely >101\u00b0F 38.3\u00b0C), sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise, loss of appetite, and if the larynx is involved, hoarseness. The hallmark of respiratory diphtheria is a pseudomembrane that appears within 2\u20133 days of illness over the mucous lining of the tonsils, pharynx, larynx, or nares and that can extend into the trachea. The pseudomembrane is firm, fleshy, grey, and adherent, and it will bleed after attempts to remove or dislodge it. Fatal airway obstruction can result if the pseudomembrane extends into the larynx or trachea, or if a piece of it becomes dislodged. In severe respiratory diphtheria, cervical lymphadenopathy and soft-tissue swelling in the neck give rise to a \u201cbull-neck\u201d appearance. Systemic complications, including myocarditis and polyneuropathies, can result from absorption of diphtheria toxin from the infection site. However, cutaneous and nasal diphtheria are localized and rarely associated with systemic toxicity. The case-fatality ratio of respiratory diphtheria is 5%\u201310%."

They are usually found:\nIn women: on the outer vaginal lips (labia), vagina, cervix, around the anus, and on the thighs or buttocks In men: on the penis, scrotum, around the anus, on the thighs or buttocks In both sexes: on the tongue, mouth, eyes, gums, lips, fingers, and other parts of the body Before the blisters appear, the person may feel the skin tingling, burning, itching, or have pain at the site where the blisters will appear When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful. These ulcers eventually crust over and slowly heal over 7 - 14 days or more\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\nEnlarged and tender lymph nodes in the groin during an outbreak Painful urination Women may have vaginal discharge or, occasionally, be unable to empty the bladder and require a urinary catheter\nA second outbreak can appear weeks or months after the first. It is almost always less severe and shorter than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease. Once a person is infected, however, the virus hides within nerve cells and remains in the body. The virus can remain \"asleep\" (dormant) for a long period of time (this is called latency). The infection can flare-up or reactivate at any time. Events that can trigger latent infection to become active and bring on an outbreak include:\nFatigue Genital irritation Menstruation Physical or emotional stress Trauma\nAttacks can recur as seldom as once per year, or so often that the symptoms seem continuous.

HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) is spread from one person to another during sexual contact. You may be infected with herpes when your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has herpes.\nHerpes is most likely to be transmitted by contact with the skin of an infected person who has visible sores, blisters, or a rash (an active outbreak), but you can also catch herpes from an infected person's skin when they have NO visible sores present (and the person may not even know that he or she is infected), or from an infected persons mouth (saliva) or vaginal fluids.\nBecause the virus can be spread even when there are no symptoms or sores present, a sexual partner who has been infected with herpes in the past but has no active herpes sores can still pass the infection on to others. Genital HSV-2 infections is more common in women (approximately 1 of every 4 women is infected) than it is in men (nearly 1 of every 8 men is infected)."

More than 70 different types of HPV exist.\nSeveral types of HPV cause genital warts, which may be found on the penis, vulva, urethra, vagina, cervix, larynx, and around and in the anus. Other types of HPV cause common or flat warts on other parts of the skin, such as the hands. However, warts on the hands or other parts of the body do not cause genital warts.\nHPV infection around the genitals is common, although most people have no symptoms. Even if you do NOT have symptoms, however, you must be treated to prevent complications and spreading the condition to others. In women, HPV can invade the walls of the vagina and cervix. These warts are flat and not easy to see without special procedures. Certain types of HPV can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix, cervical cancer, or anal cancer. These are called high-risk types of HPV. The following are important facts about how HPV and genital warts can be spread:\nHPV infection is passed from one person to another through sexual contact involving the skin of the anus, mouth, or vagina, or the mucus membrane. It is possible for genital warts and HPV to spread, even when no warts can be seen. You may not see warts for at least 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected with HPV. It may also take longer, even years, so when you first notice genital warts, it does not mean that you or your partner has had sexual contact with someone outside of your relationship. Not everyone who has been exposed to the HPV virus and genital warts wil develop them.\nThe following factors put you at higher risk for getting genital warts, having them spread more quickly, having them return, or having other complications of HPV:\nHaving multiple sexual partners Not knowing whether someone you had sex with had STIs Becoming sexually active at an early age Using tobacco and alcohol Having stress and other viral infections (such as herpes) at the same time Being pregnant Having an immune system that does not work well, such as during cancer treatment or AIDS\nIf a child has genital warts, you should suspect sexual abuse as a possible cause."

Other symptoms of acute hepatitis C include:\nFever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice (yellow color in the skin or eyes)\nThese symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, but this does not necessarily mean that the infection has also gone.\nIf you have hepatitis symptoms, or think you have been put at risk, you should consult your doctor. A blood test can determine if you have hepatitis C. When a person has the virus for more than six months the illness is called chronic hepatitis C.\nMost people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms.

Histoplasmosis is unusual enough that if you develop it, your health care provider should check to find out whether another disease is weakening your immune system. Often, those who have had chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis must follow up with their doctor, who will check for signs of relapse. In rare cases, a pulmonary histoplasmosis infection can spread through the blood to other organs. This is called disseminated histoplasmosis. People who have a suppressed immune system and very young children are more likely to develop this condition. If this occurs, the prognosis is less favorable."

Most of these problems are caused by types 6, 11, 16 or 18. \nWhen cancer develops, it may affect men and women. According to the CDC, HPV may be involved in different types of cancer, with the following incidences: \nCervical cancer: The most common HPV -associated cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV. Vulvar cancer: About 50% are linked to HPV. Vaginal cancer: About 65% are linked to HPV. Penile cancer: About 35% are linked to HPV.

        "output": "Often HPV goes away by itself within two years and does not cause health problems. It is thought that the immune system fights off HPV naturally. It is only when certain types of HPV do not go away over years that it can cause cancer. It is not known why HPV infection resolves in most, but not all cases. Unfortunately, there is no way to know which people will develop cancer or other health problems.  Considering that HPV infection may be asymptomatic, some patients may carry the virus and not know that they are infected. Accordingly, the prognosis will depend on the course of the infection, whether it is asymptomatic or it evolves into a cellular abnormality that may lead to cancer. The prognosis will therefore depend on the condition resulting from the cellular abnormalities and how early this is diagnosed, since for instance, a cervical cancer may be cured if diagnosed and operated on early, while if it is only caught late in its course, it may have a fatal outcome."

It is most common in children, particularly those in unhealthy living conditions. In adults, it may follow other skin disorders or a recent upper respiratory infection such as a cold or other virus. It is similar to cellulitis, but it only involves the top layers of the skin. Impetigo is contagious, meaning it can spread to others.

You should always try to avoid injuries. However, if you experience loss of sensation due to leprosy (or another cause), you may not feel pain, which commonly warns you of harm to your body. So, extra caution is required to ensure your body is not injured. \nThe disease may cause symptoms, such as: \nSkin lesions that may be faded/discolored, than your normal skin tone. These lesions commonly have decreased sensation to touch, heat, or pain and do not heal after several weeks to months. Growths on the skin. Thick, stiff or dry skin. Severe pain. Numbness on affected areas of the skin. Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet). Eye problems that may lead to blindness.

        "output": "Leprosy is caused by the organism Mycobacterium leprae. It is not very contagious (difficult to transmit) and has a long incubation period (time before symptoms appear), which makes it difficult to determine where or when the disease was contracted. Children are more susceptible than adults to contracting the disease.\nLeprosy has two common forms, tuberculoid and lepromatous, and these have been further subdivided. Despite this classification, both forms produce sores on the skin, but the lepromatous form is most severe, producing large, disfiguring lumps and bumps (nodules). Also, forms of the disease eventually cause nerve damage in the arms and legs, which causes sensory loss in the skin and muscle weakness. People with long-term leprosy may lose the use of their hands or feet due to repeated injury resulting from lack of sensation.\nThe disease is common in many countries worldwide, and in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. Approximately 100 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States. Most cases are limited to the South, California, Hawaii, and U.S. island possessions. Today effective medications are available, and isolation of victims in \"leper colonies\" is unnecessary. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium leprae, as well as increased numbers of cases worldwide, has led to global concern about this disease.\nEvidence suggests that the bacteria that cause leprosy are able to spread from person to person. The transmission might happen when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. This leads to the release of droplets into the air that carry the bacteria to another person. It might also happen if you are exposed to other nasal fluids (also known as secretions). Droplets and other body secretions can contain the bacteria that cause leprosy, thereby transmitting the infection."

These countries include:\nAngola Brazil Central African Republic Democratic Republic of Congo Federated States of Micronesia India Kiribati Madagascar Mozambique Nepal Republic of Marshall Islands United Republic of Tanzania\nPeople who have been in close contact with someone who has untreated Hansen\u2019s disease are also at higher risk of contracting the disease, since they may have been exposed to the leprosy bacteria. However, as soon as patients start treatment, they are no longer able to spread the disease.\nYet, according to the CDC, most adults around the world might face very little risk of contracting leprosy, since evidence shows that 95% of all adults are naturally unable to get the disease, even if they\u2019ve been exposed to the bacteria that causes it. \nIn the southern areas of the United States some armadillos are infected with leprosy. Despite the low risk of contracting the disease from contact with an armadillo, it is possible. In case of contact with an armadillo, if you decide to see a doctor, make sure to provide a complete history of armadillo contact. Your doctor can determine whether or not you have the disease. In the unlikely event that you get leprosy, your doctor can also help you get treatment.\nTherefore, whenever possible, avoid contact with armadillos, in order to further decrease the risk of contracting the disease."

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "Why is the cure rate so varied?",
        "output": "These are topics for discussion, but errors introduced in the technique can introduce false negative errors. There are numerous reasons why the cure rate is not 100%. Some of Dr. Mohs data revealed a cure rate as low as 96%, but these were often very large tumor, and previously been treated by other modalities. Some authors claim that their 5 year cure rate for primary basal cell cancer exceeded 99% while other noted more conservative cure rate of 97%. The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated basal cell cancer is about 94%. \n1. Modern frozen section method. Frozen section histology does not give the added margin of safety by the cytotoxic Mohs paste,  originally used by Dr. Mohs. This paste might have destroyed any residual cancer cells not detected by the pathologist.\n2. Missing epidermal margins. Ideally, the Mohs section should include 100% of the epidermal margin, but greater than 95% is often accepted.  Unfortunately, vigorous scrubbing, poorly controlled initial curettage, poor tissue health, technician's error, and surgeon's error can introduce areas missing epithelial margin. Some surgeon consider 70% epithelial margin acceptable, while other suggests 100% margin. In the ideal situation, 100% of the epithelial margin should be available to be reviewed on serial sectioning of the Mohs specimen.\n3. Misreading of the pathology slide. It is difficult to differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeon limits their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue.  This severely hampers their ability to determine if a structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures,  and can lead to either \"false negative\" or \"false positive\" errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons.  Surgeons who performs serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured the contiguous nature of his tumor, the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and is familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three dimensional tumor with difficult to compress margins.\n4. Compression artifact, freezing artifact, cautery artifact, tissue folds, crush artifact from forceps, relaxing incision artifact, cartilage dropping out, fat compression, poor staining, dropping of tumor, etc.  These can be introduced as the tumor is \"flattened\". Stain can run from the surgical edge, and stain the surgical margin - giving a false impression that the entire surgical margin is clear, when it is not. While some surgeon unfamiliar with the \"whole piece\" or \"PacMan\"  methods of processing might suggest that multiple piece sectioning is better than one. The more tissue sections are cut, the more artifacts in staining and tissue malformation will be introduced. It is imperative for the surgeon to be fully familiar with tissue handling and processing; and not simply relying on a trained technologist to perform his sectioning.\n5. Hard to see tumor in heavy inflammatory infiltrate.  This can occur with squamous cell carcinoma, especially when complicated with local infection, or intrinsic lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Because of abnormal peripheral blood profile, response to inflammatory skin conditions with patients with myelomonocytic leukemia can have appearance of atypical cells at sites of inflammation, confusing the Mohs surgeon. \n6. Perineural spread, and benign changes simulating perineural spread. Tumor spreading along a nerve can be difficult to visualize, and sometime benign plasma cells can surround the nerve, simulating cancer. \n7. Difficult to cut and process anatomical area.  Examples would be the ear, and other three dimensional structures like eyelids. The ability to make a scallop shaped incision is increasingly difficult when the surgical surface is no longer a flat plane, but is a three dimensional rigid structure.\n8. Recurrent skin cancer with multiple islands of recurrence. This can occur with either previous excision, or after electrodessication and curettage. As these residual skin cancer are often bound in scar tissue, and present in multiple location in the scar of the previous surgical defect - they are no longer contiguous in nature. Some surgeons advocate the removal of the complete scar in the treatment of \"recurrent\" skin cancers. Others advocate removing only the island of local recurrence, and leaving the previous surgical scar behind. The decision is often made depending on the location of the tumor, and the goal of the patient and physician.\n9. Unreported or underreported recurrence. Many patients simply will not return to the original surgeon to report a recurrence. Consulting surgeon on the repeat surgery will often not inform the first surgeon of the recurrence. The time it takes for a recurrent tumor to be visible to the patient might be 5 or more years. Quoted \"cure\" rates must be looked upon with the understanding that a 5 year cure rate might not necessary be correct. As basal cell carcinoma is a very slowly progressing tumor, a 5 year no recurrence rate might not be adequate. Longer follow up might be needed to detect a slow growing tumor left in the surgical scar.\n10. Poor training of the surgeon/pathologist/histotechnologist. While Mohs surgery is essentially a technical method of tissue handling and processing, the skill and training of the surgeon can greatly affect the outcome. The house of card is built with a foundation of good tissue handling, good surgical skill and hemostasis, and the bricks are the tissue processing and staining technique. A surgeon without a good histotechnologist is a house built with straw, and a histotechnologist without a good surgeon can not produce quality slides. While originally, surgeons learned the procedure by spending a few hours to several months with Dr. Mohs;  today, surgeons complete residency and fellowship spending hundreds of hours observing and doing Mohs surgery. It is highly encouraged that a physician interested in learning Mohs surgery should spend extended time observing, cutting, processing, and staining Mohs specimens. The histology block should be correctly mounted and cut the first time, as there is no second chances in Mohs histology. It is not a procedure that can be taught or learn in one weekend. Many residency and Mohs fellowship continue to teach the processing of only 2 Mohs sections per tumor. \nIrrespective of the problems associated with Mohs surgery, a true cure rate approaching 100% can occur with primary basal cell carcinoma (previously untreated) if proper respect of the physician's limitation, the procedure's limitation, and his laboratory staff's limitation. Conservative approach such as serial sectioning, good staining technique, and conservative Mohs margin (example: tumor at least 200 micrometre from the surgical margin) can assure the lowest recurrence rate."

People catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil contaminated with the worms. The tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways. They then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. The worms then move to the small intestine, where they attach to the wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae and pass out of the body. Unlike other worms, these larvae can reenter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin may become red and painful. This infection is uncommon in the United States. Most cases seen in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa."

It is spread by their fleas.\nThe plague bacteria can be transmitted to humans by the following ways:\nFlea bites\nPlague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic plague or septicemic plague.\nContact with contaminated fluids or tissues\nHumans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague - infected animal.\nInfectious droplets\nWhen a person has plague pneumonia, they may cough droplets containing the plague bacteria into the air. If these bacteria -containing droplets are breathed in by another person, they can cause pneumonic plague. Typically this requires direct and close contact with the person with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people.\nThis type of spread has not been documented in the United States since 1924, but still occurs with some frequency in developing countries. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague and can be infected by eating infected rodents. Sick cats pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets to their owners or to veterinarians. Several cases of human plague have occurred in the United States in recent decades as a result of contact with infected cats.\nIn the Middle Ages in Europe, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. Plague can still be found in Africa, Asia, and South America. Today, plague is rare in the United States, but it has been known to occur in parts of California, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.\nThe three most common forms of plague are:\nBubonic plague -- an infection of the lymph nodes Pneumonic plague -- an infection of the lungs Septicemic plague -- an infection of the blood\nThe time between infection and development of symptoms is typically 2 to 7 days, but may be as short as 1 day for pneumonic plague. Risk factors for plague include a recent flea bite and exposure to rodents, especially rabbits, squirrels, or prairie dogs, or scratches or bites from infected domestic cats."

        "output": "A, B, and O are the three major blood types. The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells. In people who have different blood types, these molecules act as immune system triggers (antigens).\nEach person has a combination of two of these surface molecules. Type O lacks any molecule. The different blood types are:\nType A (AA or AO molecules) Type B (BB or BO molecules) Type AB Type O\nPeople who have one blood type form proteins (antibodies) that cause their immune system to react against other blood types. Being exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when a patient needs to receive blood (transfusion) or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be matched to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction. For example:\nA patient with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood A patient with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood A patient with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood\nBecause type O lacks any surface molecules, type O blood does not cause an immune response. This is why type O blood cells can be given to patients of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. However, people with type O can only receive type O blood.\nSince antibodies are in the liquid part of blood (plasma), both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction."

    {
        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What are the causes of Acromegaly?",
        "output": "Acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of GH by the pituitary gland. The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually \u201ccascade\u201d or flow in a series, affecting each other\u2019s production or release into the bloodstream. GH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or \u201caxis,\u201d is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH. Secretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production. The hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\nIn more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm\u2014where the optic nerves cross\u2014leading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroid\u2014another hormone-producing gland\u2014then thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. Some GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly. Rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign. Most pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.\nRarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.\nIn patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Physicians should carefully analyze all \u201cpituitary tumors\u201d removed from patients with acromegaly so they do not overlook the rare possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder."

Because of salt loss, a craving for salty foods also is common. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, is more severe in children than in adults. In women, menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Because the symptoms progress slowly, they are usually ignored until a stressful event like an illness or an accident causes them to become worse. This is called an Addisonian crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency. In most cases, symptoms are severe enough that patients seek medical treatment before a crisis occurs. However, in about 25 percent of patients, symptoms first appear during an addisonian crisis.\nSymptoms of an addisonian crisis include;\nSudden penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs Severe vomiting and diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure Loss of consciousness\nIf left untreated, an addisonian crisis can be fatal."

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What causes Addison's disease?",
        "output": "Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).\nAddison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. About 70 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldostertone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.\nThe polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II. Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:\nUnderactive parathyroid glands Slow sexual development Pernicious anemia Chronic Candida infections Chronic active hepatitis Hair loss (in very rare cases)\nType II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:\nAn underactive thyroid gland Slow sexual development Diabetes Vitiligo Loss of pigment on areas of the skin\nScientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is inherited because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies.\nTuberculosis (TB), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at autopsy in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.\nLess common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are\nChronic infection, mainly fungal infections Cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands Amyloidosis Surgical removal of the adrenal glands\nThis form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as prednisone for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ulcerative colitis, block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from:\nTumors or infections of the area Loss of blood flow to the pituitary Radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors Surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus Surgical removal of the pituitary gland"

There are no specific physical or occupational restrictions. Routine care includes regular physician visits, avoidance of dehydration, and the use of extra medication during illness. Pregnancy is possible, but will require extra monitoring of the replacement medication.

Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening, and can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart.\nIn most cases the symptoms are mild. In severe cases fluid collects in the lungs (pulmonary edema) causing extreme shortness of breath. This further reduces how much oxygen enters the bloodstream and reaches vital organs and tissue. Brain swelling may also occur (cerebral edema). This can cause confusion, coma, and, if untreated, death.\nApproximately 20% of people will develop mild symptoms at altitudes between 6,300 to 9,700 feet, but pulmonary and cerebral edema are extremely rare at these heights.

        "output": "The brain and the eye work together to produce vision. Light enters the eye and is changed into nerve signals that travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Amblyopia is the medical term used when the vision in one of the eyes is reduced because the eye and the brain are not working together properly. The eye itself looks normal, but it is not being used normally because the brain is favoring the other eye. As a result, the affected eye fails to develop normal vision, and therefore has trouble seeing details. It has been estimated to affect 1\u20135% of the population. \nAmblyopia is caused primarily by one of two factors: improper alignment of the eyes (known as strabismus), or unequal refractive power. If the child's eyes are not properly aligned, the brain will receive two different images from the eyes. Perceiving double vision, the brain will not use the image from the weaker eye. This eye, through lack of use, gradually loses its ability to function.\nThe second primary cause of amblyopia is significantly unequal refractive power in the two eyes. For example, one eye may be very farsighted or nearsighted while the other eye may have normal vision. Again the brain receives different images from the two eyes and suppresses the image from the weaker eye.\nOther causes of amblyopia include:\nFamily history of amblyopia Astigmatism in both eyes Childhood cataracts\nAmbylopia can also occur physiologically after tobacco or alcohol consumption."

It can be divided into two main categories: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome\nAt birth, because of external sex characteristics of females, this type of people are usually raised as females and have a female gender identity. During puberty, their female secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts develope. At the same time, they have sparse or absent hair in the pubic area and under the arms. They do not menstruate and testes are undescended. At adult, they are unable to conceive a child for without uterus. Undescended testes can become cancerous later in life if they are not surgically removed.\nIncomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome\nAt birth, they may have normal female sex characteristics, both male and female sex characteristics, or normal male sex characteristics. They may be raised as males or as females, and may have a male or a female gender identity. During puberty, people with mild androgen insensitivity tend to experience female secondary sex characteristics, such as breast enlargement. Many of them have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina but no cervix or uterus. Their testes locate in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. In adult, they are often infertile."

In most people, the damage occurs in the left temporal lobe, although it can result from damage to the right lobe as well. People with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create made-up words. For example, someone with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may say, \u201cYou know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.\u201d As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say. People with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding speech, and they are often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals usually have no body weakness because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.\n2. Broca\u2019s aphasia: A type of non-fluent aphasia is Broca\u2019s aphasia. People with Broca\u2019s aphasia have damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. They frequently speak in short phrases that make sense but are produced with great effort. They often omit small words such as \u201cis,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d and \u201cthe.\u201d For example, a person with Broca\u2019s aphasia may say, \u201cWalk dog,\u201d meaning, \u201cI will take the dog for a walk,\u201d or \u201cbook book two table,\u201d for \u201cThere are two books on the table.\u201d People with Broca\u2019s aphasia typically understand the speech of others fairly well. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated. People with Broca\u2019s aphasia often have right-sided weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for motor movements.\n3. Global aphasia: Another type of non-fluent aphasia, results from damage to extensive portions of the language areas of the brain. Individuals with global aphasia have severe communication difficulties and may be extremely limited in their ability to speak or comprehend language."

For young children (around 10 years old) the recovery takes three weeks.\nThe real possibility of life-threatening peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation and treatment. The patient may have to undergo a medical evacuation. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e. outside of a proper hospital), when a timely medical evaluation was impossible.\nTypical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more difficult to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually.

It is important to keep in mind that there are many forms of arthritis, and a specific diagnosis of the type you have may help to direct the proper treatment. Although there is no cure for most types of arthritis, early diagnosis and appropriate management are important, especially for inflammatory types of arthritis. For example, early use of disease-modifying drugs can affect the course of rheumatoid arthritis. An early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can make a difference in pain and joint damage. The earlier you understand your arthritis, the earlier you can start managing your disease and making healthy lifestyle changes to help your arthritis."

        "output": "Ascariasis is caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is found in association with poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and in places where human feces are used as fertilizer.Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae within the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae then move through the bloodstream to the lungs, exit up through the large airways of the lungs, and are swallowed back into the stomach and reach the small intestine. During movement through the lungs the larvae may produce an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Once they are back in the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 \u2013 24 months. It is estimated that 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults."

        "output": "Autism is a physical condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities remain unknown, but this is a very active area of research. There are probably a combination of factors that lead to autism.\nGenetic factors seem to be important. For example, identical twins are much more likely than fraternal twins or siblings to both have autism. Similarly, language abnormalities are more common in relatives of autistic children. Chromosomal abnormalities and other nervous system (neurological) problems are also more common in families with autism.\nA number of other possible causes have been suspected, but not proven. They involve:\nDiet Digestive tract changes Mercury poisoning The body's inability to properly use vitamins and minerals\nAutism and Vaccines:\nMany parents are worried that some vaccines are not safe and may harm their baby or young child. They may ask their doctor or nurse to wait, or even refuse to have the vaccine. However, it is important to also think about the risks of not having the vaccination.\nSome people believe that the small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) that is a common preservative in multidose vaccines causes autism or ADHD. However, studies have NOT shown this risk to be true.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, and The Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that no vaccine or component of any vaccine is responsible for the number of children who are currently being diagnosed with autism.

Family income, education, and lifestyle do not seem to affect the risk of autism.\nSome doctors believe the increased incidence in autism is due to newer definitions of autism.

Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\nHuman infection with avian influenza viruses: There are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. Usually, \u201cavian influenza virus \u201d refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion / excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and has been limited, inefficient and unsustained.\n\u201cHuman influenza virus \u201d usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.\nDuring an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds."

        "output": "It is important to understand that back pain is a symptom of a medical condition, not a diagnosis itself. Back pain may occur by itself, or along with other symptoms. Back pain is categorized into acute pain and chronic pain.\nPain that hits you suddenly\u2014after falling from a ladder, being tackled on the football field, or lifting a load that is too heavy, for example\u2014is acute pain. Acute pain comes on quickly and often leaves just as quickly. To be classified as acute, pain should last no longer than 6 weeks. Acute pain is the most common type of back pain.\nChronic pain, on the other hand, may come on either quickly or slowly, and it lingers a long time. In general, pain that lasts longer than 3 months is considered chronic. Chronic pain is much less common than acute pain."
    },
    {
        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What causes Back pain?",
        "output": "Medical problems that can cause back pain include the following:\nMechanical problems: A mechanical problem is a problem with the way your spine moves or the way you feel when you move your spine in certain ways. Perhaps the most common mechanical cause of back pain is a condition called intervertebral disk degeneration (such as degenerative disk disease), which simply means that the disks located between the vertebrae of the spine are breaking down with age. As they deteriorate, they lose their cushioning ability. This problem can lead to pain if the back is stressed. Other mechanical causes of back pain include spasms, muscle tension, and ruptured disks, which are also called herniated disks.\nInjuries: Spine injuries such as sprains and fractures can cause either short-lived or chronic pain. Sprains are tears in the ligaments that support the spine, and they can occur from twisting or lifting improperly. Fractured vertebrae are often the result of osteoporosis. Less commonly, back pain may be caused by more severe injuries that result from accidents or falls.\nAcquired conditions and diseases: Many medical problems can cause or contribute to back pain. They include: Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that does not usually cause pain until middle age Spondylolisthesis Various forms of arthritis, including: Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Kidney stones or kidney infections Endometriosis, which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus. Fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread muscle pain and fatigue.\nAdditionally, although osteoporosis itself is not painful, it can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Pregnancy is also a common cause of back pain.\nInfections and tumors: Although they are not common causes of back pain, infections can cause pain when they involve the vertebrae, a condition called osteomyelitis, or when they involve the disks that cushion the vertebrae, which is called diskitis. Tumors also are relatively rare causes of back pain.\nEmotional: Although the causes of back pain are usually physical, emotional stress can play a role in how severe pain is and how long it lasts. Stress can affect the body in many ways, including causing back muscles to become tense and painful."

    {
        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "Who is at highest risk for Back pain ?",
        "output": "Although anyone can have back pain, a number of factors increase your risk. They include:\nAge: The first attack of low back pain typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 40. Back pain becomes more common with age.\nFitness level: Back pain is more common among people who are not physically fit. Weak back and abdominal muscles may not properly support the spine. \u201cWeekend warriors\u201d\u2014people who go out and exercise a lot after being inactive all week\u2014are more likely to suffer painful back injuries than people who make moderate physical activity a daily habit. Studies show that low-impact aerobic exercise is good for the disks that cushion the vertebrae, the individual bones that make up the spine.\nDiet: A diet high in calories and fat, combined with an inactive lifestyle, can lead to obesity, which can put stress on the back.\nHeredity: Some causes of back pain, such as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that affects the spine, have a genetic component.\nRace: Race can be a factor in back problems. African American women, for example, are two to three times more likely than white women to develop spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a vertebra of the lower spine\u2014 also called the lumbar spine\u2014 slips out of place.\nThe presence of other diseases: Many diseases can cause or contribute to back pain. These include various forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers elsewhere in the body that may spread to the spine.\nOccupational risk factors: Having a job that requires heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling, particularly when this involves twisting or vibrating the spine, can lead to injury and back pain. An inactive job or a desk job may also lead to or contribute to pain, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in an uncomfortable chair.\nCigarette smoking: Although smoking may not directly cause back pain, it increases your risk of developing low back pain and low back pain with sciatica. For example, smoking may lead to pain by blocking your body\u2019s ability to deliver nutrients to the disks of the lower back. Repeated coughing due to heavy smoking may also cause back pain. It is also possible that smokers are just less physically fit or less healthy than nonsmokers, which increases the likelihood that they will develop back pain. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that causes weak, porous bones, which can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Furthermore, smoking can slow healing, prolonging pain for people who have had back injuries, back surgery, or broken bones."

However, a trip to the doctor is probably a good idea if you have numbness or tingling, if your pain is severe and doesn\u2019t improve with medication and rest, or if you have pain after a fall or an injury.\nIn most cases, it is best to see your primary care physician first. In many cases, he or she can treat the problem. In other cases, your doctor may refer you to an appropriate specialist.\nIt is also important to see your doctor if you have pain along with any of the following problems: trouble urinating; weakness, pain, or numbness in your legs; fever; or unintentional weight loss. Such symptoms could signal a serious problem that requires treatment soon."

They believe that the facial nerve swells and becomes inflamed in reaction to the infection, causing pressure within the Fallopian canal and leading to an infarction (the death of nerve cells due to insufficient blood and oxygen supply). In some mild cases (where recovery is rapid), there is damage only to the myelin sheath of the nerve. The myelin sheath is the fatty covering-which acts as an insulator-on nerve fibers in the brain.\nThe disorder has also been associated with influenza or a flu-like illness, headaches, chronic middle ear infection, high blood pressure, diabetes, sarcoidosis, tumors, Lyme disease, and trauma such as skull fracture or facial injury."

Instead they experience periods of high energy levels and impulsiveness that are not as extreme as mania (called hypomania). These periods alternate with episodes of depression. A mild form of bipolar disorder called cyclothymia involves less severe mood swings. People with this form alternate between hypomania and mild depression. People with bipolar disorder type II or cyclothymia may be wrongly diagnosed as having depression.\nIn most people with bipolar disorder, there is no clear cause for the manic or depressive episodes. The following may trigger a manic episode in people with bipolar disorder:\nLife changes such as childbirth Medications such as antidepressants or steroids Periods of sleeplessness Recreational drug use"

Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible. A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity. For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma (4). Ewing sarcoma is not strongly associated with any heredity cancer syndromes, congenital childhood diseases, or previous radiation exposure (2)."

To develop new treatments and better ways to use current treatments, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring clinical trials in many hospitals and cancer centers around the country. Clinical trials are a critical step in the development of new methods of treatment. Before any new treatment can be recommended for general use, doctors conduct clinical trials to find out whether the treatment is safe for patients and effective against the disease.\nPeople interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service (CIS) (see below) at 1\u2013800\u20134\u2013CANCER and in the NCI booklet Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies, which can be found at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/Taking-Part-in-Cancer-Treatment-Research-Studies on the Internet.

        "output": "Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side.  The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike \"out of the blue\" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as'The Devil's grip' reflect this symptom.\nOnce inside the body, the coxsackie viruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackie virus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there. The chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms. The pain usually comes in waves that last 15 to 30 minutes, although some people report having pain episodes that last for several hours. The pain can be so severe that you have trouble breathing, sweat a lot and become anxious."

Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria, and fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass.\nWhile this immune response can protect the brain by isolating the infection, it can also do more harm than good. The brain swells. Because the skull cannot expand, the mass may put pressure on delicate brain tissue. Infected material can block the blood vessels of the brain.\nThe germs that cause a brain abscess usually reach the brain through the blood. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is to blame. Germs may also travel from a nearby infected area (for example, an ear infection) or enter the body during an injury (such as a gun or knife wound) or surgery.\nIn children with heart disease or a birth defect, such as those with tetralogy of fallot, infections are more able to reach the brain from the intestines, teeth, or other body areas."

In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are most common.\nGliomas come from glial cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. The gliomas are divided into three types:\nAstrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (less malignant), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (most malignant). Oligodendroglial tumors also can vary from less malignant to very malignant. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors. These are called mixed gliomas. Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor.\nMeningiomas are another type of brain tumor. These tumors:\nOccur most commonly between the ages of 40 - 70 Are much more common in women Are usually (90% of the time) benign, but still may cause devastating complications and death due to their size or location.

A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.\nAge: The chance of getting breast cancer goes up as a woman gets older. Most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 60. This disease is not common before menopause.\nPersonal history of breast cancer: A woman who had breast cancer in one breast has an increased risk of getting cancer in her other breast.\nFamily history: A woman's risk of breast cancer is higher if her mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer. The risk is higher if her family member got breast cancer before age 40. Having other relatives with breast cancer (in either her mother's or father's family) may also increase a woman's risk.\nCertain breast changes: Some women have cells in the breast that look abnormal under a microscope. Having certain types of abnormal cells (atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS) increases the risk of breast cancer.\nGene changes: Changes in certain genes increase the risk of breast cancer. These genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, and others. Tests can sometimes show the presence of specific gene changes in families with many women who have had breast cancer. Health care providers may suggest ways to try to reduce the risk of breast cancer, or to improve the detection of this disease in women who have these changes in their genes. NCI offers publications on gene testing.\nReproductive and menstrual history: The older a woman is when she has her first child, the greater her chance of breast cancer. Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who went through menopause after age 55 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who never had children are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who take menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin after menopause also appear to have an increased risk of breast cancer. Large, well-designed studies have shown no link between abortion or miscarriage and breast cancer.\nRace: Breast cancer is diagnosed more often in white women than Latina, Asian, or African American women.\nRadiation therapy to the chest: Women who had radiation therapy to the chest (including breasts) before age 30 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. This includes women treated with radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Studies show that the younger a woman was when she received radiation treatment, the higher her risk of breast cancer later in life.\nBreast density: Breast tissue may be dense or fatty. Older women whose mammograms (breast x-rays) show more dense tissue are at increased risk of breast cancer.\nTaking DES (diethylstilbestrol): DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.) Women who took DES during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. The possible effects on their daughters are under study.\nBeing overweight or obese after menopause: The chance of getting breast cancer after menopause is higher in women who are overweight or obese.\nLack of physical activity: Women who are physically inactive throughout life may have an increased risk of breast cancer. Being active may help reduce risk by preventing weight gain and obesity.\nDrinking alcohol: Studies suggest that the more alcohol a woman drinks, the greater her risk of breast cancer."

        "output": "Lumps in a woman are often caused by fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, and cysts.\nFibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. Fibrocystic breast changes do not increase your risk of breast cancer. Symptoms are usually worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts.\nFibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery. They move easily inside the breast tissue. Like fibrocystic changes, they occur most often during the reproductive years. Usually, they are not tender. Except in rare cases, they do not become cancerous later. A doctor can feel during an exam whether a lump is a fibroadenoma. The only way to be sure, however, is to remove or biopsy the lump.\nCysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, especially just before your menstrual period.\nOther causes of breast lumps include:\nBreast cancer\nInjury -- sometimes if your breast is badly bruised, there will be a collection of blood that feels like a lump. These lumps tend to get better on their own in a few days or weeks. If they do not improve, your doctor may have to drain the blood.\nLipoma -- a collection of fatty tissue\nMilk cysts (sacs filled with milk) and infections (mastitis), which may turn into an abscess. These typically occur if you are breastfeeding or have recently given birth."

Most likely the disorder is due to a congenital predisposition - some people have smaller carpal tunnels than other people do. Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in people who perform repetitive motions of the hand and wrist.\nTyping on a computer keyboard is probably the most common cause of carpal tunnel. Other causes include:\nperforming assembly line work Sewing Driving Assembly line work Painting Writing Use of tools (especially hand tools or tools that vibrate) Sports such as racquetball or handball Playing some musical instruments\nOther causes include wrist injury, or swelling due to certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

        "output": "Studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of cervical cancer, infection with HPV (human papillomavirus) is the main cause of cervical cancer. HPV infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more:\nHPV Infection:\nHPV is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix. An HPV infection that doesn't go away can cause cervical cancer in some women. HPV is the cause of nearly all cervical cancers. These viruses are passed from person to person through sexual contact or skin to skin contact.\nMost adults have been infected with HPV at some time in their lives, but most infections clear up on their own. Some types of HPV can cause changes to cells in the cervix. If these changes are found early, cervical cancer can be prevented by removing or killing the changed cells before they can become cancer cells. A vaccine for females ages 9 to 26 protects against two types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer.\nLack of Regular Pap Test:\nCervical cancer is more common among women who don't have regular Pap test s. The Pap test helps doctors find abnormal cells. Removing or killing abnormal cells usually prevents cervical cancer.\nSmoking:\nAmong women who are infected with HPV, smoking cigarettes slightly increases the risk of cervical cancer.\nWeakened Immune System:\nInfection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increases the risk of cervical cancer.\nSexual History:\nWomen who have had many sexual partners have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Also, a woman who has had sex with a man who has had many sexual partners may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. In both cases, the risk of developing cervical cancer is higher because these women have a higher risk of HPV infection.\nUsing Birth Control Pills for a Long Time:\nUsing birth control pills for a long time (5 or more years) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection. However, the risk decreases quickly when women stop using birth control pills.\nHaving Many Children:\nStudies suggest that giving birth to many children (5 or more) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection.\nDES (diethylstilbestrol):\nDES may increase the risk of a rare form of cervical cancer in daughters exposed to this drug before birth. DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.)"

The Pap test is one of the most reliable and effective cancer screening tests available, it also can find other conditions that might need treatment, such as infection or inflammation. In addition to the Pap test; the main test for cervical cancer, the HPV test may be used for screening women aged 30 years and older, or women of any age who have unclear Pap test results. If you are 30 or older, and your screening tests are normal, your chance of getting cervical cancer in the next few years is very low. For that reason, your doctor may tell you that you will not need another screening test for up to three years. But you should still go to the doctor regularly for a check-up that may include a pelvic exam. It also is important for you to continue getting a Pap test regularly, even if you think you are too old to have a child, or are not having sex anymore."

You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy. However, you may not feel like eating during or soon after treatment. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth sores) can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to cope with these problems. Research shows that people with cancer feel better when they stay active. Walking, yoga, swimming, and other activities can keep you strong and increase your energy. Exercise may reduce nausea and pain and make treatment easier to handle. It also can help relieve stress. Whatever physical activity you choose, be sure to talk to your doctor before you start. You'll need regular checkups after treatment for cervical cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems with checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for the return of cancer. Even when cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained somewhere in the body after treatment. Checkups may include a physical exam, Pap tests, and chest x-rays."

The average child develops 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.\nThe blisters are usually first seen on the face, chest, back, scalp and then to the rest of the body associated with intense itch.\nAfter one or two days, the blisters become cloudy and form scabs. The newly formed blisters occur in groups. They are usually seen on the eyelids, in the mouth and in the vagina.\nNumerous blisters are observed in children suffering from eczema.\nScars are usually not formed unless the pox is infected with bacteria from scratching.\nDespite receiving a vaccine, some children may still develop a mild case of chickenpox. Recovery is usually much quicker and they are left with only a few pox (fewer than 30). Such cases are often harder to diagnose. These children can still spread chickenpox to others."

The same virus also causes herpes zoster (shingles) in adults.\nChickenpox spreads easily to others by touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister, or if someone with chickenpox in the vicinity coughs or sneezes. People with mild illness may be contagious.\nAn individual with chickenpox is contagious one to two days even before the blisters appear. Infected individuals remain contagious until all the blisters have turned into crusts.\nMost cases of chickenpox are observed in children younger than ten years old. The disease is usually mild, although serious complications sometimes occur. Older children and adolescents usually get sicker than younger children.\nChildren born to mothers who have had chickenpox or who have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to get chickenpox before they are 1 year old. If in case the children get chickenpox, it's often a mild form. The reason for this would be the antibodies from their mother's blood help protect the children. Children under 1-year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox in their lifetime or if they hadn't received the vaccination against chickenpox can get severe chickenpox.\nSuffering from illness or the use of medications such as in chemotherapy and the use of steroids may lead severe chickenpox symptoms more commonly in children whose immune system is compromised."

You get it by breathing in fungal particles from soil. The infection starts in the lungs. There are three forms of coccidioidomycosis: acute, chronic, or disseminated.\nAcute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. It almost always mild, with few or no symptoms, and goes away without treatment. The incubation period -- the time between breathing in the spores and becoming sick -- is 7 to 21 days. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis can develop 20 or more years after initial infection. Infections (lung abscesses) can form and rupture, releasing pus (empyema) between the lungs and ribs (pleural space). Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a widespread form of the disease. Infection spreads to other parts of the body, including the skin, brain, bones, and heart. Meningitis occurs in up to half of all people with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Traveling to an area where the fungus is commonly seen raises your risk for this infection. You are more likely to develop a serious infection if: You are of Native American, African or Philippine descent You have a weakened immune systems due to AIDS, diabetes, or medications that suppress the immune system."

They are found in the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. If you are missing just one pigment, you might have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. Other times, people have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness almost always have problems identify reds and greens, too.\nColor blindness is often inherited genetically. It is most commonly inherited from mutations in a X-linked recessive fashion, but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations \u2013 mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and many different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database at Johns Hopkins University).\nInherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:\nCone dystrophy Cone-rod dystrophy Achromatopsia (aka rod monochromatism, aka stationary cone dystrophy, aka cone dysfunction syndrome) Blue cone monochromatism Leber's congenital amaurosis Retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness)\nOther causes of color blindness include:\nBrain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome or other accidents and trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe Damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions"

As color blindness is commonly inherited in a X-linked recessive fashion, about 8 percent of males, but only 0.5 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it be one color, a color combination, or another mutation.   The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.\nIn addition to those who are genetically predisposed to color blindness, people who suffer from brain or retinal damage, or who take the drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), are at an increased risk of color blindness."

Additionally, symptoms vary based on the specific type of conjunctivitis:\nAllergic conjunctivitis: Main article: Allergic conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is typically itchy, sometimes distressingly so, and often involves some eye swelling. Chronic allergy often causes just itching or irritation. Allergic conjunctivitis often causes pale watery swelling of the conjunctiva and sometimes the whole eyelid. There is frequently a sticky mucus discharge, and there is variable redness. Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as \"pink eye.\" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as' gound') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin. However, discharge is not essential to the diagnosis, contrary to popular belief. Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Like viral conjunctivitis, it usually affects only one eye but may spread easily to the other eye. However, it is dormant in the eye for three days before the patient shows signs of symptoms. Chemical conjunctivitis: Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is irritable or painful when the infected eye is pointed far down or far up. Discharge and itch are usually absent. It show primarily marked redness. This is the only group in which severe pain may occur."

Furthermore, a contact lens may damage the cornea as it scratches against the surface upon removal, thereby allowing easier bacterial penetration. Examples of viruses, fungi, and parasites that can cause corneal ulcers are:\nHerpes simplex - This virus can lead to herpes simplex keratitis, which is a serious viral infection that may cause repeated attacks that are triggered by stress, exposure to sunlight, or any condition that impairs the immune system.\nFusarium - These fungi have been associated with fungal keratitis. The infection can occur after a corneal injury involving plant material, such as from a tree branch, or in immunosuppressed people.\nAcanthamoeba - These parasites can lead to acanthamoeba keratitis mostly in contact lens users, especially those who attempt to make their own homemade cleaning solutions. It can also cause problems for people who wear their contact lenses while swimming.\nOther causes of corneal ulcers include:\nAbrasions (scratches) Foreign bodies in the eye Inadequate eyelid closure Severely dry eyes Severe eye allergies Various inflammatory disorders Chemical burns that can injure the cornea"

Almost all cases have resulted from new mutations, however, and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nGeneticists believe that the symptoms associated with Costello syndrome are a result of a missense mutation in the HRAS gene. The HRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell growth and division. Mutations that cause Costello syndrome lead to the production of an HRAS protein that is permanently active. Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. This unchecked cell division may predispose to the development of benign and malignant tumors. It remains unclear how mutations in the HRAS gene cause the other features of Costello syndrome, but many of the signs and symptoms may result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division."

Genetic disorders commonly associated with craniosynostosis include Crouzon syndrome, Apert syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Chotzen syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome.\nHowever, most cases of craniosynostosis occur in a family with no history of the condition, and children with craniosynostosis are otherwise healthy and have normal intelligence.\nThere are different types of craniosynostosis. Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main (sagittal) suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type of craniosynostosis tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.\nFrontal plagiocephaly is the next most common form. It is the closure of one side of the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It is more common in girls.\nMetopic synostosis is a rare form of craniosynostosis that affects the suture close to the forehead.

It usually first appears between ages 20 and 70, with average age at onset of symptoms in the late 50s.\nCJD can be grouped into classic or new variant disease.\nThe classic types of CJD are:\nSporadic CJD makes up the majority of cases. It occurs for no known reason. Average age at onset is 65 Familial CJD results when a person inherited the abnormal prion (inherited CJD is rare) Classic CJD is not related to mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalitis).\nNew variant CJD (nvCJD):\nNew variant CJD is an infectious form that is related to mad cow disease. The infection responsible for the disease in cows is believed to be the same one responsible for vCJD in humans.\nNew variant CJD accounts for less than 1% of cases, and tends to affect younger people. It can result when someone is exposed to contaminated products. Other nvCJD cases have occurred when people were given corneal transplants from infected donors, and from contaminated electrodes that were used in brain surgery (before it was known how to properly disinfect instruments). There have not been any cases of nvCJD reported in the U.S.\nCJD may be related to several other diseases also thought to be caused by prions, including kuru (seen in New Guinea women who ate the brains of deceased relatives as part of a funerary ritual), scrapie (found in sheep), chronic wasting disease (found in deer), and other rare human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia."

One missing piece, called TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) is involved in control of cell growth, and may play a role in how some of the features of this syndrome develop.\nMost cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A minority of cases result from one parent carrying a rearrangement of chromosome 5 called a translocation and passing this on to the baby.\nMost cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.\nAbout 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder."

The human immune system is made from cells and different proteins that protect people from infection. The most popular theory is that the body\u2019s immune system reacts abnormally in people with Crohn\u2019s disease, mistaking bacteria, foods, and other substances for being foreign. The immune system\u2019s response is to attack these \u201cinvaders.\u201d During this process, white blood cells accumulate in the lining of the intestines, producing chronic inflammation, which leads to ulcerations and bowel injury.\nScientists do not know if the abnormality in the functioning of the immune system in people with Crohn\u2019s disease is a cause, or a result, of the disease. Research shows that the inflammation seen in the GI tract of people with Crohn\u2019s disease involves several factors: the genes the patient has inherited, the immune system itself, and the environment. Foreign substances, also referred to as antigens, are found in the environment. One possible cause for inflammation may be the body\u2019s reaction to these antigens, or that the antigens themselves are the cause for the inflammation.

        "input": "What causes Cushing's syndrome?",
        "output": "Cushing\u2019s syndrome occurs when the body\u2019s tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids\u2014steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol\u2014such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\nThese benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing\u2019s disease, affects women five times more often than men.\nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women.\nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood. Adrenocortical carcinomas\u2014adrenal cancers\u2014are the least common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\nMost cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing\u2019s syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing\u2019s syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors."

What is the correct venue to complain when an AFD is closed out of process and the history is removed, then the deletion review is closed out of process. The rules for deletion review say it should stay up for 5 days, and this one was closed after 13 hours, with the vast majority of editors opposed to the speedy deletion and removal of all traces of the AFD. If you don't want people appending comments to the \"closed\" deletion review, then don't allow people to close it 13 hours after it is opened, when their viewpint is losing. Allow editors such as myself a chance to add our views. Did the owner of the Super Secret Number the Wikipedia Foundation and demand that all traces of it be removed? Did the Wikipedia legal counsel ask that oversight be applied? Is there any log to show when oversight actions are taken? Do you feel that when oversight removes something a comment to the effect should be added to the discussion page for the affected AFD? I am just checking to see if there is a process and that it is being followed. Thanks. Edison 03:45, 3 May 2007 (UTC)\nPlease read this thread to get an idea of what's going on.

For this reason, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse or when using a diaphragm for birth control.

        "input": "What causes Diabetes insipidus?",
        "output": "There are 4 Types of Diabetes insipidus\nThe most common form of serious DI, central DI, results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of ADH. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times. The drug prevents water excretion, and water can build up now that the kidneys are making less urine and are less responsive to changes in body fluids.\nNephrogenic DI results when the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH. The kidneys \u2019 ability to respond to ADH can be impaired by drugs \u2014like lithium, for example\u2014and by chronic disorders including polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, kidney failure, partial blockage of the ureters, and inherited genetic disorders. Sometimes the cause of nephrogenic DI is never discovered. Desmopressin will not work for this form of DI. Instead, a person with nephrogenic DI may be given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or indomethacin. HCTZ is sometimes combined with another drug called amiloride. The combination of HCTZ and amiloride is sold under the brand name Moduretic. Again, with this combination of drugs, one should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times.\nDipsogenic DI is caused by a defect in or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses ADH secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin or other drugs should not be used to treat dipsogenic DI because they may decrease urine output but not thirst and fluid intake. This fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, a condition that lowers the concentration of sodium in the blood and can seriously damage the brain. Scientists have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic DI.\nGestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and results when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother. The placenta is the system of blood vessels and other tissue that develops with the fetus. The placenta allows exchange of nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus.Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used."

It may occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, or in people who have not been able to control their diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:\n* Infection\nOther illness such as heart attack or stroke Medications that lower glucose tolerance or increase fluid loss (in people who are losing or not getting enough fluid)\nNormally, the kidneys try to make up for high glucose levels in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. If you do not drink enough fluids, or you drink fluids that contain sugar, the kidneys can no longer get rid of the extra glucose. Glucose levels in the blood can become very high as a result. The blood then becomes much more concentrated than normal (hyperosmolarity).\nHyperosmolarity is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances that normally cause water to move into the bloodstream. This draws the water out of the body's other organs, including the brain. Hyperosmolarity creates a cycle of increasing blood glucose levels and dehydration."

The disease was first noticed in the United States in the early 1900s, around the time processed foods were introduced into the American diet. Consumption of processed foods greatly reduced Americans\u2019 fiber intake.\nDiverticular disease is common in developed or industrialized countries\u2014particularly the United States, England, and Australia \u2014where low-fiber diets are consumed. The disease is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.\nFiber is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Some fiber, called soluble fiber, dissolves easily in water. It takes on a soft, jelly-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes almost unchanged through the intestines. Both kinds of fiber help prevent constipation by making stools soft and easy to pass.\nConstipation \u2014or hard stool\u2014may cause people to strain when passing stool during a bowel movement. Straining may cause increased pressure in the colon, which may cause the colon lining to bulge out through weak spots in the colon wall. These bulges are diverticula.\nLack of exercise also may be associated with a greater risk of forming diverticula, although the reasons for this are not well understood.\nDoctors are not certain what causes diverticula to become inflamed. The inflammation may begin when bacteria or stool are caught in the diverticula. An attack of diverticulitis can develop suddenly and without warning."

        "output": "To diagnose diverticular disease, the doctor asks about medical history, does a physical exam, and may perform one or more diagnostic tests. Because most people do not have symptoms, diverticulosis is often found through tests ordered for another ailment. For example, diverticulosis is often found during a colonoscopy done to screen for cancer or polyps or to evaluate complaints of pain or rectal bleeding.\nWhen taking a medical history, the doctor may ask about bowel habits, pain, other symptoms, diet, and medications. The physical exam usually involves a digital rectal exam. To perform this test, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to detect tenderness, blockage, or blood. The doctor may check stool for signs of bleeding and test blood for signs of infection. If diverticulitis is suspected, the doctor may order one of the following radiologic tests:\nAbdominal ultrasound. Sound waves are sent toward the colon through a handheld device that a technician glides over the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the colon and other organs, and their echoes make electrical impulses that create a picture\u2014called a sonogram \u2014on a video monitor. If the diverticula are inflamed, the sound waves will also bounce off of them and show the location. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan is a noninvasive x ray that produces cross-section images of the body. The doctor may inject dye into a vein and the person may be given a similar mixture to swallow. The person lies on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The dye helps to show complications of diverticulitis such as perforations and abscesses."

        "output": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rapidly-worsening form of muscular dystrophy. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker's muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.\nBecause of the way the disease is inherited, males are more likely to develop symptoms than are women. The sons of females who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

        "input": "What causes Dystonia?",
        "output": "It is not exactly clear what causes dystonias. There are two types of dystonia: acquired dystonia and idiopathic dystonia.\nAcquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or disease-related damage to the basal ganglia. Birth injury (particularly due to lack of oxygen), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy-metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke can cause dystonic symptoms. Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.\nAbout half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia. Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited in a dominant manner; i.e., only one carrier parent need contribute the dystonia gene for the disease to occur, each child having a 50% chance of being a carrier. In dystonia, however, a carrier may or may not develop a dystonia and the symptoms may vary widely even among members of the same family. The product of one defective gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia; but the possibility exists that another gene or genes and environmental factors may play a role. Researchers have identified more than 15 different genetic mutations that may contribute to dystonia.\nWhether you have acquired or idiopathic dystonia, researchers think that it is caused by a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. Scientists suspect a defect in the body's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help cells in the brain communicate with each other.\nThe ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure and/or more effectively treat people now affected. Scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the pattern of muscle activity in persons with focal dystonias. One of the most important characteristics is the failure of reciprocal inhibition, a normal process in which muscles with opposite actions work without opposing each other. In dystonia, the tightening of muscles is associated with an abnormal pattern of muscles fighting each other. The search for the gene or genes responsible for some forms of dominantly inherited dystonias continues."

A very small number of people in the United States, who were infected with the fourth type of the virus, known as Ebola Reston, did not develop any signs of disease. The disease can be passed to humans from infected animals and animal materials.

        "output": "Ebola virus is able to infect someone by the following mechanism:\nEbola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa, infection has occurred through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. It is important to reduce contact with high-risk animals, including not picking up dead animals, found lying in the forest or handling their raw meat.\nOnce a person comes into contact with an animal that has Ebola, it can spread within the community from human to human.\nInfection occurs from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people. Infection can also occur if broken skin or mucous membranes of a healthy person come into contact with environments that have become contaminated with an Ebola patient\u2019s infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing, bed linen, or used needles.\nPeople are infectious, as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. For this reason, infected patients receive close monitoring from medical professionals and receive laboratory tests to ensure the virus is no longer circulating in their systems before they return home. When the medical professionals determine it is okay for the patient to return home, they are no longer infectious and cannot infect anyone else in their communities."

However, in rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, stomach area, or cervix.\nAn ectopic pregnancy is often caused by a condition that blocks or slows the movement of a fertilized egg through the fallopian tube to the uterus. This may be caused by a physical blockage in the tube by hormonal factors and by other factors, such as smoking.\nMost cases of scarring are caused by:\nPast ectopic pregnancy Past infection in the fallopian tubes Surgery of the fallopian tubes\nUp to 50% of women who have ectopic pregnancies have had swelling (inflammation) of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nSome ectopic pregnancies can be due to:\nBirth defects of the fallopian tubes Complications of a ruptured appendix Endometriosis Scarring caused by previous pelvic surgery\nIn a few cases, the cause is unknown.\nSometimes, a woman will become pregnant after having her tubes tied (tubal sterilization). Ectopic pregnancies are more likely to occur 2 or more years after the procedure, rather than right after it.

        "output": "Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) are more likely to suffer from emphysema. A1AD allows inflammatory enzymes (such as elastase) to destroy the alveolar tissue. Most A1AD patients do not develop clinically significant emphysema, but smoking and severely decreased A1AT levels (10-15%) can cause emphysema at a young age. The type of emphysema caused by A1AD is known as panacinar emphysema (involving the entire acinus) as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking. Panacinar emphysema typically affects the lower lungs, while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lungs. A1AD causes about 2% of all emphysema. Smokers with A1AD are at the greatest risk for emphysema. Mild emphysema can often develop into a severe case over a short period of time (1\u20132 weeks)."

        "output": "Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women after menopause, and affects more white women than black women. Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are more likely to have more advanced disease at diagnosis, and are more likely to die from endometrial cancer than white women.\nSome of the risk factors for endometrial cancer are:\nEstrogen Exposure\nEstrogen exposure through estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy. A combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy in post menopausal women, however, has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nBeginning to have menstrual periods at an early age also increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a woman's risk of endometrial cancer. Similarly, women who reach menopause at an older age are exposed to estrogen for a longer time and have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nNever being pregnant is also a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTamoxifen\nTamoxifen is one of a group of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease, but it increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.\nAnother drug in the SERM group, raloxifene, is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nInherited risk\nHereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by changes in certain genes. Women who have HNPCC syndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have HNPCC syndrome.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nWomen who have polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries) have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nBody fat\nObesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This may be because obesity is related to other risk factors such as estrogen levels, polycystic ovary syndrome, lack of physical activity, and a diet that is high in saturated fats.\nIt is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of endometrial cancer."

        "output": "An extradural hemorrhage is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence. This type of bleeding is more common in young people because the membrane covering the brain is not as firmly attached to the skull as it is in older people.\nAn extradural hemorrhage occurs when there is a rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery, which then bleeds into the space between the dura mater and the skull. The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures.\nThis is most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle or automobile accidents. Extradural hemorrhages can be caused by venous (from a vein) bleeding in young children.\nRapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain, causing a rapid increase of the pressure inside the head (intracranial pressure). This pressure may result in additional brain injury.\nAn extradural hemorrhage is an emergency because it may lead to permanent brain damage and death if left untreated. There may be a rapid worsening within minutes to hours, from drowsiness to coma and death."

It keeps food from entering the airways, so you don't cough or choke after swallowing.\nEpiglottitis is swelling of the epiglottis, which leads to breathing problems. Swelling of the epiglottis is usually caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), although it may be caused by other bacteria or viruses. Upper respiratory infections can lead to epiglottitis. Medicines or diseases that weaken the immune system can make adults more prone to epiglottitis.\nEpiglottitis is most common in children between 2 and 6 years old. Rarely, epiglottitis can occur in adults, and it may be easily overlooked in such patients.\nThe occurrence of epiglottitis has decreased dramatically in the United States since the H. influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine became a routine childhood immunization in the late 1980s."

It causes problems swallowing, with the feeling like the food is stuck in the throat or chest. At first it is often mild, but then gets worse over time. At last, patients can no longer eat and can only consume water.\nChest pain or chest burning sensation: Chest pain with swallowing may occur if the tumor is large enough to block the esophagus. Some patients describe a feeling of pressure or burning in the chest.\nHiccups: This happens because of digestive dysfunction of the esophagus.\nVomiting blood: When a tumor invades a blood vessel, vomiting up blood occurs. This may be the first symptom in some patients.\nWeight loss: This occurs because swallowing problems prevent patients from eating enough to maintain their weight. Other factors include loss of appetite and increase in metabolism from the cancer.\nInfections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms, but only a doctor can give a proper diagnosis.

These risk factors are outlined below:\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): In some people, acid can reflex from the stomach into the esophagus. This disease is called Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Clinical data show that people with GERD have a 2-16 times higher risk of getting adenocarcinoma of the esophagus than those without GERD.\nBarrett's esophagus: Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the squamous cells that usually line the esophagus are replaced with glandular cells when reflux of stomach acid into the lower esophagus continues for a long period of time.\nAchalasia: This is a disease in which the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus does not relax properly. As the result, food has trouble in passing into the stomach and tends to collect in the esophagus, causing the esophagus above this muscle to become dilated. People with achalasia have a risk of esophageal cancer that is at least 15 times higher than the normal risk.\nStomach bacteria: Epidemiological surveys demonstrate patients treated to get rid of H. pylori often get adenocarcinoma of the esophagus more often than expected.\nInjury to the esophagus: Chemicals such as lye may cause a severe chemical burn in the esophagus. The scar tissue can make the esophagus very narrow after the injury heals. People with these narrow esophageal passages have a higher rate of the squamous cell type of esophageal cancer after several years.\nWorkplace exposures: Clinical surveys show exposure to chemical fumes, such as solvents used for dry cleaning, may lead to an increased risk of esophageal cancer.\nTobacco and alcohol\nDiet: About 15% of esophageal cancer can be linked to a diet that is poor in fruits and vegetables.\nObesity\nGender: Men have a 3-fold higher rate of getting esophageal cancer than women.\nAge: Most cases occur in those 65 years or older."

        "output": "Risk factor is anything that changes your chance of getting a disease like cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are nonmodifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to the general population.\nRisk factors for lymphoma are as under:\nAge Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethnicity, and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.\nExposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it\u2019s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia, and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nAutoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sj\u00f6gren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured (rough) surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces)."

A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center.

The ill person may be pale, weak, and tired, and should see his or her physician for treatment. (The typical rash of fifth disease is rarely seen in these persons.) Once the infection is controlled, the anemia resolves. Furthermore, persons who have problems with their immune systems may also develop a chronic anemia with parvovirus B19 infection that requires medical treatment. People who have leukemia or cancer, who are born with immune deficiencies, who have received an organ transplant, or who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at risk for serious illness due to parvovirus B19 infection.

        "output": "Humans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare. Some cases were caused by laboratory accidents. Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat, except in the mouth before the meat is swallowed.\nThere is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as \"hand, foot and mouth disease\", that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; the cause, Coxsackie A virus, is different from FMDV. Coxsackie A also belongs to the Picornaviridae family. Coxsackie viruses belong to the Enteroviruses within the Picornaviridae. Because FMD rarely infects humans, but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health. Farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epizootic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down."

        "output": "The four major types of glaucoma have their own unique causes. However, before reviewing them, a brief overview of the anatomy of the eye may be helpful in understanding the causes of this disease:\nThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is always being made in the back of the eye. It leaves the eye through channels in the front of the eye in an area called the anterior chamber angle, or simply the angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid out of the eye will cause pressure to build up in the eye. This pressure is called intraocular pressure (IOP). In most cases of glaucoma, this pressure is high and causes damage to the major nerve in the eye, called the optic nerve.\nMore specific causes by each major type of glaucoma are:\nOpen-angle (chronic) glaucoma\nThe cause is unknown. An increase in eye pressure occurs slowly over time. The pressure pushes on the optic nerve and the retina at the back of the eye. Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are at particularly high risk for this disease.\nAngle-closure (acute) glaucoma\nIt occurs when the exit of the aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked. Dilating eye drops and certain medications may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.\nCongenital glaucoma'\nIt is present at birth and results from the abnormal development of the fluid outflow channels in the eye. It is often hereditary and tends to run in families.\nSecondary glaucoma\nIt is caused as complications of other medical conditions and/or procedures, including eye surgery, advanced cataracts, eye injuries, certain eye tumors, and uveitis. It can be caused by drugs such as corticosteroids, which are used to treat eye inflammations. Pigmentary glaucoma is caused when pigment from the iris breaks off, thereby slowing the fluid drainage and blocking the meshwork. Neovascular glaucoma is a severe form of secondary glaucoma that is linked to diabetes."

People with a family history of glaucoma.\nAmong African Americans, studies show that glaucoma is:\nFive times more likely to occur in African Americans than in Caucasians. About four times more likely to cause blindness in African Americans than in Caucasians. Fifteen times more likely to cause blindness in African Americans between the ages of 45-64 than in Caucasians of the same age group.\nA comprehensive dilated eye exam can reveal more risk factors, such as:\nHigh eye pressure Thinness of the cornea Abnormal optic nerve anatomy.\nIn some people with certain combinations of these high-risk factors, medicines in the form of eye drops reduce the risk of developing glaucoma by about half."

It's important to carefully and regularly follow up with your doctor.\nAngle-closure glaucoma Rapid diagnosis and treatment of an attack is key to saving your vision. Seek emergency care immediately if you have symptoms of an angle-closure attack, as blindness will occur in a few days if it is not treated.\nCongenital glaucoma Early diagnosis and treatment is important.

Eighty-five percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk for developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone.\nOther risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:\nOral cavity. Sun exposure (lip); possibly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salivary glands. Radiation to the head and neck. This exposure can come from diagnostic x-rays or from radiation therapy for noncancerous conditions or cancer. Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Certain industrial exposures, such as wood or nickel dust inhalation. Tobacco and alcohol use may play less of a role in this type of cancer. Nasopharynx. Asian, particularly Chinese, ancestry; Epstein-Barr virus infection; occupational exposure to wood dust; and consumption of certain preservatives or salted foods. Oropharynx. Poor oral hygiene; HPV infection and the use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content are possible, but not proven, risk factors. Hypopharynx. Plummer-Vinson (also called Paterson-Kelly) syndrome, a rare disorder that results from iron and other nutritional deficiencies. This syndrome is characterized by severe anemia and leads to difficulty swallowing due to webs of tissue that grow across the upper part of the esophagus. Larynx. Exposure to airborne particles of asbestos, especially in the workplace.\nImmigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk for oral cancer. Also, consumption of mate, a tea-like beverage habitually consumed by South Americans, has been associated with an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and larynx.\nPeople who are at risk for head and neck cancers should talk with their doctor about ways they can reduce their risk.

        "output": "Although early-stage head and neck cancers (especially laryngeal and oral cavity) have high cure rates, up to 50% of head and neck cancer patients present with advanced disease.  Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement.\nConsensus panels in America (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC and Europe) have established staging systems for head and neck squamous cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are staged according to the TNM classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a \u201cstage\u201d of the cancer, from I to IVB. \nEven after successful definitive therapy, head and neck cancer patients face tremendous impacts on quality of life. Despite marked advances in reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and conservation approaches to certain malignancies, some patients continue to have significant functional deficits.\nSurvival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of patients cured of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9.1%  to 23%  at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage HNSCC. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called field cancerization.\nThroat cancer has numerous negative effects on the body systems.\nAs it can impair a person\u2019s ability to swallow and eat, throat cancer affects the digestive system. The difficulty in swallowing can lead to a person to choke on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food\u2019s smooth travels down into the esophagus and beyond.\nThe treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person\u2019s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer. If the respiratory system is unable to bring oxygen into the body, the oxygen deprivation will cause the body's cells to wither and die, causing one to become weaker and sicker.\nLike any cancer, metastasization affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells and affects the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body's immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body."

Hemochromatosis can be hard to identify because early symptoms are similar to those of many other common diseases.\nAlthough most people reach middle-age before they have symptoms of hemochromatosis, some people may have symptoms at a younger age. The symptoms depend on which organs are being affected by the iron buildup.\nEarly indications of hemochromatosis are often like those of other diseases and include the following symptoms:\nFatigue (feeling very tired) Weakness Weight loss Abdominal pain Joint pain\nAs iron builds up in the body organs, hemochromatosis may also produce the following symptoms:\nLoss of menstrual periods or early menopause Loss of sex drive (libido) or impotence Loss of body hair Shortness of breath\nAlthough not a physical symptom, another possible indication of hemochromatosis is having an elevated liver enzyme test.\nAs the disease progresses, hemochromatosis may cause the following more serious problems:\nArthritis Liver problems, such as cirrhosis (or scarring of the liver) and liver cancer High blood sugar and diabetes Abdominal pain that does not go away Severe fatigue (feeling extremely tired and having a lack of energy) Heart problems (such as a heart beat that is not regular) Heart failure (such as the heart not pumping blood as well as it did previously) Gray-colored or bronze-colored skin"

Men and women have the same chance of inheriting two copies of this gene.\nNot everyone who is born with two copies of the mutated HFE gene develops the disease. Scientists do not know what percentage of people who have two copies of the mutated HFE gene develop the disease. Some studies have shown that as few as 1 in 100 people will develop symptoms. Other studies have shown that as many as 50 in 100 people may develop symptoms. A person with only one copy of the mutated HFE gene is usually healthy and is said to be a \u201ccarrier\u201d of the genetic condition.

Although both men and women can inherit the gene defect, men are more likely to be diagnosed with the effects of hemochromatosis than women. Other factors that increase risk are:\nEthnic Background: White people of northern European descent (for example, families from England, Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, France, and Scandinavia) have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation. Family History: People with a close relative (grandparent, mother, father, sibling, niece, nephew) who has hemochromatosis have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation.\nThere are other factors which influence the rate at which iron is absorbed by the body:\nDietary supplements: Taking iron supplements or multivitamins with iron can speed up the rate at which iron builds up in the body. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills containing iron. Eating foods that contain iron is fine. Taking vitamin C supplements may cause the body to absorb more iron. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills with more than 500 milligrams of vitamin C per day. Eating foods that contain vitamin C is fine. Blood loss: Losing iron by giving blood and losing iron through menstruation and unrecognized bleeding may slow the start of hemochromatosis. Therefore, men at risk for hemochromatosis usually develop the disease and its symptoms at a younger age than women who are at risk."

        "output": "Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route; that is when an uninfected person ingests food or water that has been contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water.\nPeople with HAV are infectious from the beginning of the incubation period (about a month before symptoms) until one week after they become jaundiced\nOther common ways of acquiring Hepatitis A are:\nDirect Person-to-person transmission Eating food made by someone who has HAV who did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom. Not washing hands after changing a diaper (young children often are asymptomatic). Having anal or oral sex with someone who has HAV. Indirect transmission Eating uncooked food that is HAV -contaminated. Cooked food can also cause hepatitis if not heated to 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) for 1 minute after being contaminated with HAV. Drinking contaminated water. This is a common route of infection in underdeveloped countries. Chlorinated water, such as tap water in developed countries, kills HAV."

An injection is typically offered to anyone living with someone who has HAV. If given within 14 days of contact, the injection can prevent Hepatitis A, or at least make symptoms its milder. There is no cure for Hepatitis A. The best advice to get healthy quicker is to avoid alcohol and get plenty of fluids and rest. One should check with their doctor before taking medicine which may harm the liver. Hepatitis can cause liver failure and death, but this is rare and occurs mostly with people over the age of 50 and have other liver diseases as well."

This is called chronic hepatitis B. Many people who have chronic hepatitis B have few or no symptoms. They may not even look sick. As a result, they may not know they are infected. However, they can still spread the virus to other people. Symptoms may not appear for up to 6 months after the time of infection. Early symptoms may include:\nAppetite loss Abdominal pain Extreme fatigue Fever, low-grade Muscle and joint pain Nausea and vomiting Dark urine Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\nPeople with chronic hepatitis may have no symptoms, even though gradual liver damage may be occurring. Over time, some people may develop symptoms of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\nMore than 90% of healthy adults who are infected with the hepatitis B virus will recover and be completely rid of the virus within 6 months."

        "output": "Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).\nIn highly endemic areas, HBV is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth, or from person to person in early childhood.\nPerinatal or early childhood transmission may also account for more than one third of chronic infections in areas of low endemicity, although in those settings, sexual transmission and the use of contaminated needles, especially among injecting drug users, are the major routes of infection.\nThe hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus is 75 days on average, but can vary from 30 to 180 days. The virus may be detected 30 to 60 days after infection and persists for variable periods of time.\nHepatitis B infection can be spread through having contact with the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and other body fluids of someone who already has a hepatitis B infection.\nWays of infection include:\nBlood transfusions (not common in the United States) Direct contact with blood in health care settings Sexual contact with an infected person Tattoo or acupuncture with unclean needles or instruments Shared needles during drug use Shared personal items (such as toothbrushes, razors, and nail clippers) with an infected person\nThe hepatitis B virus is not spread by contaminated food or water, and cannot be spread casually in the workplace."

Less than 5% of adults who are infected with the hepatitis B virus develop the chronic condition. Chronic hepatitis B infection increases the risk for liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. People who have chronic hepatitis B can transmit the infection. They are considered carriers of the disease, even if they do not have any symptoms.\nLiver cancer is almost always fatal and often develops in people at an age when they are most productive and have family responsibilities.\nIn developing countries, most people with liver cancer die within months of diagnosis.

Unlike other cancers, Hodgkin's disease is often very curable, even in its late stages.\nWith the right treatment, more than 90% of people with stage I or II Hodgkin's lymphoma survive for at least 10 years. If the disease has spread, the treatment may be more intense. However, 90% of people with advanced disease survive for at least 5 years.\nPatients who survive 15 years after treatment are more likely to later die from other causes, including complications of the treatment, rather than from Hodgkin's disease.\nPeople with Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease returns within a year after treatment or who do not respond to the first treatment have a poorer outlook.\nYou will need to have regular exams and imaging tests for years after your treatment. This helps your doctor check for signs of the cancer returning, and for any long-term treatment effects."

        "output": "American doctor George Huntington first described the disorder in 1872.\nHuntington's disease is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome #4. The defect causes a part of DNA, called a CAG repeat, to occur many more times than it is supposed to. Normally, this section of DNA is repeated 10 to 35 times. But in persons with Huntington's disease, it is repeated 36 to 120 times.\nAs the gene is passed on from one generation to the next, the number of repeats called a CAG repeat expansion tend to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the greater your chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, it becomes evident at younger and younger ages.\nThere are two forms of Huntington's disease. The most common is adult-onset Huntington's disease. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid 30s and 40s.\nAn early-onset form of Huntington's disease accounts for a small number of cases and begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms may resemble those of Parkinson's disease with rigidity, slow movements, and tremor.\nIf one of your parents has Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene for the disease. If you get the gene from your parents, you will develop the disease at some point in your life, and can pass it onto your children. If you do not get the gene from your parents, you cannot pass the gene onto your children."

        "output": "The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.\nWhen calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney. When the calcium level returns to normal, parathyroid hormone production slows down.\nThere are two main types of hyperparathyroidism.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is caused by enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. This leads to too much parathyroid hormone, which raises the level of calcium in the blood. The term \"hyperparathyroidism\" generally refers to primary hyperparathyroidism.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is when the body produces extra parathyroid hormone because the calcium levels are too low. This is seen when vitamin D levels are low or when calcium is not absorbed from the intestines. Correcting the calcium level and the underlying problem will bring the parathyroid levels in the normal range.\nIf the parathyroid glands continue to produce too much parathyroid hormone even though the calcium level is back to normal, the condition is called \"tertiary hyperthyroidism.\" It occurs especially in patients with kidney problems"

The higher the GH levels are, the worse of the prognosis will be.

        "output": "Infant RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed.\nThe disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery, protective substance called surfactant, which helps the lungs inflate with air and keeps the air sacs from collapsing. This substance normally appears in fully developed lungs.\nInfant RDS can also be the result of genetic problems with lung development.\nThe earlier a baby is born, the less developed the lungs are and the higher the chance of Infant RDS. Most cases are seen in babies born before 28 weeks. It is very uncommon in infants born full-term (at 40 weeks).\nIn addition to prematurity, the following increase the risk of Infant RDS:\nA brother or sister who had RDS. Diabetes in the mother. Cesarean delivery. Delivery complications that reduce blood flow to the baby. Multiple pregnancy (twins or more). Rapid labor.\nThe risk of Infant RDS may be decreased if the pregnant mother has chronic, pregnancy-related high blood pressure or prolonged rupture of membranes, because the stress of these situations can cause the infant's lungs to mature sooner."

        "output": "Causes of ulcerative colitis:\nThe cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. It may affect any age group, although there are peaks at ages 15 - 30 and then again at ages 50 - 70.\nThe disease usually begins in the rectal area and may eventually extend through the entire large intestine. Repeated swelling (inflammation) leads to thickening of the wall of the intestine and rectum with scar tissue. Death of colon tissue or sepsis may occur with severe disease.\nThe symptoms vary in severity and may start slowly or suddenly. Many factors can lead to attacks, including respiratory infections or physical stress.\nCauses of Crohn's disease: While the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, the condition is linked to a problem with the body's immune system response.\nNormally, the immune system helps protect the body, but with Crohn's disease the immune system can't tell the difference between good substances and foreign invaders. The result is an overactive immune response that leads to chronic inflammation. This is called an autoimmune disorder.\nThere are five different types of Crohn's disease:\nIleocolitis is the most common form. It affects the lowest part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon). Ileitis affects the ileum. Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine (jejunum). Crohn's (granulomatous) colitis only affects the large intestine.\nA person's genes and environmental factors seem to play a role in the development of Crohn's disease. The body may be overreacting to normal bacteria in the intestines.\nThe inflammation related to Crohn's disease frequently occurs at the end of the small intestine that joins the large intestine, but it may occur in any area of the digestive tract. There can be healthy patches of tissue between diseased areas. The ongoing inflammation causes the intestinal wall to become thick."

Every so often an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear: this is known as a flare-up. Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or require medication. The time between flare-ups may be anywhere from weeks to years, and varies wildly between patients - a few have never experienced a flare-up."

Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping it move into cells.\nMost of the time when your blood sugar level drops too low, the pancreas stops making insulin until your blood sugar returns to normal. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, even when your blood sugar drops too low.\nHigh blood insulin levels cause low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.\nInsulinomas are rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors in adults.\nThese tumors are very rare in children. Most children with high blood insulin levels have many areas of overactive insulin-releasing cells in the pancreas, instead of a single tumor.\nTaking medications that cause too much insulin in the blood, either accidentally or on purpose, is about as common as insulinoma.\nMore than 90% of insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors.

This is because blood vessels in the brain of premature infants are not yet fully developed and are extremely fragile. The blood vessels grow stronger after 30 weeks of pregnancy.\nIVH is more common in premature babies who have had respiratory distress syndrome, high blood pressure, and other conditions. The condition may also occur in healthy premature babies who were born without injury. IVH may develop in full-term babies, but this is very uncommon.\nIVH is rarely present at birth. If it occurs, it will usually be in the first several days of life. The condition is quite rare after 1 month of age, no matter how early the baby was born.\nIVH falls into four groups, called grades. The higher the grade, the more severe the bleeding.\nGrades 1 and 2 involve a small amount of bleeding and do not usually cause long-term problems. Grades 3 and 4 involve more severe bleeding, which presses on or leaks into brain tissue. Blood clots can form and block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus)."

When this happens, the stones can block the flow of urine out of the kidneys. This causes swelling of the kidney or kidneys, causing pain. The pain is usually severe.\nKidney stones are common. A person who has had kidney stones often gets them again in the future. Kidney stones often occur in premature infants.\nSome types of stones tend to run in families. Certain kinds of stones can occur with bowel disease, ileal bypass for obesity, or renal tubule defects.\nThere are different types of kidney stones. The exact cause depends on the type of stone.\nCalcium stones are most common. They occur more often in men than in women, and usually appear between ages 20 - 30. They are likely to come back. Calcium can combine with other substances, such as oxalate (the most common substance), phosphate, or carbonate to form the stone. Oxalate is present in certain foods. Diseases of the small intestine increase the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones. Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria. This disorder runs in families and affects both men and women. Struvite stones are mostly found in women who have a urinary tract infection.

You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or secretions from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia)\nPneumonia caused by bacteria tends to be the most serious. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.\nThe most common pneumonia-causing germ in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in people whose immune system is impaired (due to AIDS or certain medications that suppress the immune system). Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae are other bacteria that can cause pneumonia. Tuberculosis can cause pneumonia in some people, especially those with a weak immune system.\nViruses are also a common cause of pneumonia, especially in infants and young children.\nSee also: Respiratory syncytial virus\n{{#ev:youtube|_JUEVEENE4M}}"

It is usually done in case the tumor is in chest, abdomen or limbs or bones. It helps to understand whether tumor has damaged the bone or spread to other areas.\nBiopsy: A biopsy is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of liposarcoma. It could be a needle biopsy or surgical biopsy. In needle biopsy, the doctor usually performs a punch biopsy and removes a tiny round piece of tissue using needle or a small tool. For bigger tissues, an incision may be made and surgical biopsy is used. The sample is sent to a lab where the pathologists can detect the tissues under the microscope and identify the type.\nComputed tomography CT scan and biopsy: Local CT scans are often used to diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. A CT machine takes multiple images of your body and various organs to check for tumor and extent of spread. A dye may be injected to visualize better and take clearer images. Inform the doctor if there is a prior allergy to the contrast dye. CAT scan confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs nearby. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. CT scans can also be used to guide biopsy and a biopsy sample is usually removed and looked at under a microscope.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. The magnets and the computer takes multiple pictures of your body with the tumor and helps to visualize the organs, blood vessels, bones, soft tissues and helps in diagnosing accurately. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient\u2019s vein to create a better picture. Inform the doctor if you have prior contrast dye allergy. Do not wear metals while undergoing the proceedure as metals can cause injury.\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan: When doing this test, a small amount of a radioactive medium is injected into your body and absorbed by the organs or tissues. This radioactive substance gives off energy which in turn is used to produce the images. PET can provide more helpful information than either CT or MRI scans. It is useful to see if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and it is also useful for your doctor to locate where the cancer has spread. Inform the caregiver if you had prior contrast allergy.\nWhole Bone Scan: The goal of a whole body bone scan is to show if a cancer has metastasized to your bones."

        "input": "Who is at highest risk for Lymphoma ?",
        "output": "Risk factor is anything that changes your chance of getting a disease like cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are non modifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to general population.\nRisk factors for lymphoma are as under:\nAge Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethinicity and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.\nExposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it\u2019s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia,and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nAutoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sj\u00f6gren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-barr virus (EBV) Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured (rough) surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces)."

        "output": "At first there may not be any symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, central vision may be affected. It is very important to note that macular degeneration typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision, meaning patients will not have complete vision loss from this disease. Although specific symptoms vary by whether the form is dry or wet, both forms cause no pain.\nMore detailed symptoms by type include:\nDry macular degeneration: The most common early sign is blurred vision in the center of the field of vision. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them. Often objects in the central vision look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. Often this blurred vision will go away in brighter light. A patient may have trouble reading print or seeing other details, but can generally see well enough to walk and perform most routine activities. If the loss of these light-sensing cells becomes great, people may see a small, but growing, blind spot in the middle of their field of vision. In the later stages, patients may not be able to recognize faces until people are close to them. Dry macular degeneration generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. Wet macular degeneration: The classic early symptom is that straight lines appear distorted and wavy. This results when fluid from the leaking blood vessels gathers and lifts the macula, distorting vision. A small blind spot may also appear in wet macular degeneration, resulting in loss of one's central vision. Central vision loss can occur very quickly. If this occurs, the patient urgently needs evaluation by an ophthalmologist with experience in retina disease."

Obesity: Research studies suggest a link between obesity and the progression of early and intermediate stage macular degeneration to advanced macular degeneration. Race: Caucasians are much more likely to lose vision from macular degeneration than African Americans. Family history: Those with immediate family members who have macular degeneration are at a higher risk of developing the disease. Gender: Women appear to be at greater risk than men.

It can be fatal within a few hours of the manifestation of the primary symptoms.\nMalaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions.\nMalaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite is inactive over the winter.\nIn certain areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides and some antibiotics.

The ovaries make less of these hormones over time. The specific symptoms and how significant (mild, moderate, or severe) they vary from woman to woman.\nA gradual decrease of estrogen generally allows your body to slowly adjust to the hormonal changes. Hot flashes and sweats are at their worst for the first 1 - 2 years after the last period. Menopause symptoms may last 5 or more years.\nEstrogen levels may drop suddenly after some medical treatments, as is seen when the ovaries are removed surgically (called surgical menopause). Chemotherapy and anti-estrogen treatment for breast cancer are other examples. Symptoms can be more severe and start more suddenly in these circumstances.\nAs a result of the fall in hormone levels, changes occur in the entire female reproductive system. The vaginal walls become less elastic and thinner. The vagina becomes shorter(vaginal atrophy). Lubricating secretions from the vagina become watery. The outside genital tissue thins. This is called atrophy of the labia."

There are many causes of mental retardation, but doctors find a specific reason in only 25% of cases.\nA family may suspect mental retardation if the child's motor skills, language skills, and self-help skills do not seem to be developing, or are developing at a far slower rate than the child's peers.\nFailure to adapt (adjust to new situations) normally and grow intellectually may become apparent early in a child's life. In the case of mild retardation, these failures may not become recognizable until school age or later.\nThe degree of impairment from mental retardation varies widely, from profoundly impaired to mild or borderline retardation. Less emphasis is now placed on the degree of retardation and more on the amount of intervention and care needed for daily life.\nCauses of mental retardation can be roughly broken down into several categories:\nInfections (present at birth or occurring after birth): Congenital Cytomegalovirus Congenital rubella syndrome Congenital toxoplasmosis Encephalitis HIV infection Listeriosis Meningitis\nChromosomal abnormalities: Chromosome deletions (such as cri du chat syndrome Chromosomal translocations (a gene is located in an unusual spot on a chromosome, or located on a different chromosome than usual) Defects in the chromosome or chromosomal inheritance (such as fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome) Errors of chromosome numbers (such as Down syndrome)\nEnvironmental: Deprivation syndrome\nGenetic abnormalities and inherited metabolic disorders: Adrenoleukodystrophy Galactosemia Hunter syndrome Hurler syndrome Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Phenylketonuria Rett syndrome Sanfilippo syndrome Tay-Sachs disease Tuberous sclerosis\nMetabolic: Congenital hypothyroidism Hypoglycemia (poorly regulated diabetes) Reye syndrome Hyperbilirubinemia (very high bilirubin levels in babies)\nNutritional: Malnutrition\nToxic: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs Lead poisoning Methylmercury poisoning\nTrauma (before and after birth): Intracranial hemorrhage before or after birth Lack of oxygen to the brain before, during, or after birth Severe head injury\nUnexplained (this largest category is for unexplained occurrences of mental retardation)"

It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase.\nThere are two types of this form of methemoglobinemia:\nType 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when red blood cells lack the enzyme. Type 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work anywhere in the body.\nThe second form of inherited methemoglobinemia is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease.\nAcquired methemoglobinemia is more common than the inherited forms. It occurs in some people after they are exposed to certain chemicals and drugs, including:\nAnesthetics such as benzocaine Benzene Certain antibiotics (including dapsone and chloroquine) Nitrites (used as additives to prevent meat from spoiling)\nThe condition may also occur in infants who are very ill or who are fed too many vegetables containing nitrates (such as beets)."

In the U.S., most people with primary tuberculous get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in the small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection.\nDisseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it does not occur until years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weaken immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medications. Infants and the elderly are also at higher risk.\nYour risk for catching TB increases if you:\nAre around people who have the disease\nLive in crowded or unclean conditions\nHave poor nutrition\nTB has become more common in the U.S. in recent years. This may be due to a larger number of TB infections in people with AIDS and HIV, an increase in the number of immune-suppressing medications, and increasing numbers of homeless people.

A stroke is sometimes called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that many areas in the brain have been injured due to a lack of blood. If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage. When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are often called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of MID begin to appear.

        "output": "This syndrome almost always involves a mother abusing her child by seeking unneeded medical attention for the child. It is rare and poorly understood. The cause is unknown.\nThe mother may fake symptoms of illness in her child by adding blood to the child's urine or stool, withholding food, falsifying fevers, secretly giving the child drugs to make the child throw up or have diarrhea, or using other tricks, such as infecting intravenous (given through a vein) lines to make the child appear or become ill.\nThese children are often hospitalized with groups of symptoms that don't quite fit any known disease. Frequently, the children are made to suffer through unnecessary tests, surgeries, or other uncomfortable procedures.\nThe parent is usually very helpful in the hospital setting and is often appreciated by the nursing staff for the care she gives her child. She is often seen as devoted and self-sacrificing, which can make medical professionals unlikely to suspect the diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\nHer frequent visits unfortunately also make the child accessible to her so that she can induce further symptoms. Changes in the child's condition are almost never witnessed by hospital staff and almost always occur only in the mother's presence.\nMunchausen syndrome occurs because of psychological problems in the adult, and is generally an attention-seeking behavior. The syndrome can be life-threatening for the child involved."

Other symptoms can last for longer.\nThe symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease occur suddenly and can arise daily or as infrequently as once a year. Vertigo, often the most debilitating symptom of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, typically involves a whirling dizziness that forces the sufferer to lie down. Vertigo attacks can lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and sweating and often come with little or no warning.\nSome individuals with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease have attacks that start with tinnitus (ear noises), a loss of hearing, or a full feeling or pressure in the affected ear. It is important to remember that all of these symptoms are unpredictable. Typically, the attack is characterized by a combination of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss lasting several hours. People experience these discomforts at varying frequencies, durations, and intensities. Some may feel slight vertigo a few times a year. Others may be occasionally disturbed by intense, uncontrollable tinnitus while sleeping. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease sufferers may also notice a hearing loss and feel unsteady all day long for prolonged periods.

        "output": "The symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are associated with a change in fluid volume within the fluid-filled tubes of the inner ear. These tubes are called semicircular canals, or labyrinths, and, along with a nerve in your skull, help interpret your body's position and maintain your balance. The labyrinth has two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth, which is encased by bone, is necessary for hearing and balance and is filled with a fluid called endolymph. When your head moves, endolymph moves, causing nerve receptors in the membranous labyrinth to send signals to the brain about the body's motion. An increase in endolymph, however, can cause the membranous labyrinth to balloon or dilate, a condition known as endolymphatic hydrops.\nMeniere's disease occurs when a part of the canal, called the endolymphatic sac, becomes swollen. This sac helps filter and remove fluid in the semicircular canals.\nThe exact cause of Meniere's disease is unknown. In some cases, it may be related to:\nHead injury Middle ear infection Syphilis\nOther risk factors include:\nAllergies Alcohol use Fatigue Recent viral illness Respiratory infection Smoking Stress Use of certain medications, including aspirin\nGenetics may also play a role.\nMany experts on M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease think that a rupture of the membranous labyrinth allows the endolymph to mix with perilymph, another inner ear fluid that occupies the space between the membranous labyrinth and the bony inner ear. This mixing, scientists believe, can cause the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Scientists are investigating several possible causes of the disease, including environmental factors, such as noise pollution and viral infections, as well as biological factors."

        "output": "Infant RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed.\nThe disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery, protective substance called surfactant, which helps the lungs inflate with air and keeps the air sacs from collapsing. This substance normally appears in fully developed lungs.\nInfant RDS can also be the result of genetic problems with lung development.\nThe earlier a baby is born, the less developed the lungs are and the higher the chance of Infant RDS. Most cases are seen in babies born before 28 weeks. It is very uncommon in infants born full-term (at 40 weeks).\nIn addition to prematurity, the following increase the risk of Infant RDS:\nA brother or sister who had RDS. Diabetes in the mother. Cesarean delivery. Delivery complications that reduce blood flow to the baby. Multiple pregnancy (twins or more). Rapid labor.\nThe risk of Infant RDS may be decreased if the pregnant mother has chronic, pregnancy-related high blood pressure or prolonged rupture of membranes, because the stress of these situations can cause the infant's lungs to mature sooner."

Invasion from a primary brain tumor to the meninges - when cancer cells lodge into small arteries causing local ischemia and blood vessel damage leading to spillage of neoplastic cells to the Virchow-Robin spaces thereby providing access to the subarachnoid space. Infiltration to the spinal cord - Cancer cells gain access to the subarachnoid space through this route via the perivascular tissues the surround the blood vessels at the brain entrance. Direct infiltration of the spinal nerve roots (dorsal and ventral) has also been documented. Cancer spread a neural pathways to reach the meninges - The CSF carries cancer cells through the brain tracts. This occurs mostly in tumors of the head and neck.  Iatrogenic - from surgical procedures involving removal of a primary brain tumor Primary neoplastic meningitis has also been documented particularly with melanoma."

Triple negative breast cancer and the HER2/neu gene positivity displays tropism for CNS metastasis. Among the histologic subtypes of breast cancer, loblular carcinoma demonstrated the highest prevalence for neoplastic meningitis. Brain surgery increases the chance of developing NM. It has been observed after resection of brain tumor (particularly piecemeal resection vs en-block resection) particularly tumors located in the cerebellum. Other cranial surgeries done with involvement of ventricular system manipulation in a patient with known brain metastasis increases the risk. Furthermore, the incidence of neoplastic meningitis seem higher in patient treated with surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery compared with radiosurgery alone. Primary brain cancer always poses a risk for the development of neoplastic meningitis. It is diagnosed in 1-2% of cases of ependymoma, medulloblastoma, germinoma and glioblastoma combined. Brain metastasis is one of the more obvious risk factors for neoplastic meningitis. Coexisting brain metastasis are associated with neoplastic meningitis in breast cancer (33-54%), lung cancer (56-82%) and melanoma (87-96%)."

        "output": "The rates of survival for neoplastic meningitis varies depending on the source of primary tumor, but generally median survival rate without treatment is limited to 1 to 2 months. With treatment, this could extend to 2 to 5 months for breast cancer, 3 to 6 months for non-small cell lung cancer and 2 to 4 months for melanoma. Factors affecting the prognosis of patients with neoplastic meningitis includes gene involvement and use of immunotherapy and other targeted therapies. For breast cancer, ER-positivity, lesser extend of initial disease and better performance status has been demonstrated to have better prognosis. For lung cancer, the use of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors confers durable responses without the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy administration. Lastly, for melanoma, primary tumors located in the trunk has been documented to have a poor prognosis, but intra-CSF administration of chemotherapy significantly improves this prognosis.  Not surprisingly, patients with poor performance status, multiple fixed neurological deficits, bulks CNS disease, co-existent carcinomatous encephalopathy and CSF flow abnormalities will do poorly with intensive treatment of disease. Death typically results from progression of neurological dysfunction.  Some retrospective studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes in neoplastic meningitis: age less than 60, long duration of symptoms, controlled systemic disease, Karnofsky performance status >/= 70, absence of encephalopathy or cranial nerve deficit, initially low CSF protein level, absence of CSF compartamentalization or bulky CNS disease manifested by impedance of CSF flow and history of primary breast tumor."

ASM helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell of the body.\nIf ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This leads to cell death and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities, but higher rates are seen in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jew population.\nNiemann-Pick Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids in the brain.\nThere may be reduced ASM activity in some cells. Type C Niemann-Pick disease has been reported in all ethnic groups but it is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.\nType D Niemann-Pick involves a defect that interferes with the movement of cholesterol between brain cells.

For example, the risk of lymphoma increases after an organ transplant or in people with HIV infection.\nThere are many different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is grouped according to how fast the cancer spreads.\nThe cancer may be low grade (slow growing), intermediate grade, or high grade (fast growing). Burkitt's lymphoma is an example of a high-grade lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a low-grade lymphoma. The cancer is further grouped by how the cells look under the microscope, for example, if there are certain proteins or genetic markers present.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, a person has a 1 in 50 chance of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. NHL most often affects adults. However, children can get some forms of lymphoma.

Fluid and digestive chemicals (enzymes) produced by the pancreas normally flow through this duct.\nIf the ducts fail to join together while the baby is developing in the womb, pancreas divisum results. Fluid from the two parts of the pancreas drains into separate areas of the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum).\nIf the pancreatic ducts become blocked, swelling and tissue damage (pancreatitis) may develop."

        "output": "No one knows the exact causes of pancreatic cancer. Doctors can seldom explain why one person gets pancreatic cancer and another does not. However, it is clear that this disease is not contagious. No one can \"catch\" cancer from another person.\nResearch has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop pancreatic cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease.\nStudies have found the following risk factors:\nAge -- The likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Most pancreatic cancers occur in people over the age of 60. Smoking -- Cigarette smokers are two or three times more likely than nonsmokers to develop pancreatic cancer. Diabetes -- Pancreatic cancer occurs more often in people who have diabetes than in people who do not. Being male -- More men than women are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Being African American -- African Americans are more likely than Asians, Hispanics, or whites to get pancreatic cancer. Family history -- The risk for developing pancreatic cancer triples if a person's mother, father, sister, or brother had the disease. Also, a family history of colon or ovarian cancer increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis -- Chronic pancreatitis is a painful condition of the pancreas. Some evidence suggests that chronic pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nOther studies suggest that exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace or a diet high in fat may increase the chance of getting pancreatic cancer.\nMost people with known risk factors do not get pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, many who do get the disease have none of these factors. People who think they may be at risk for pancreatic cancer should discuss this concern with their doctor. The doctor may suggest ways to reduce the risk and can plan an appropriate schedule for checkups."

        "input": "How to know you have Pancreatic cancer (Diagnosis)?",
        "output": "If a patient has symptoms that suggest pancreatic cancer, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history. The doctor may perform a number of procedures, including one or more of the following:\nPhysical exam -- The doctor examines the skin and eyes for signs of jaundice. The doctor then feels the abdomen to check for changes in the area near the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. The doctor also checks for ascites, an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen. Lab tests -- The doctor may take blood, urine, and stool samples to check for bilirubin and other substances. Bilirubin is a substance that passes from the liver to the gallbladder to the intestine. If the common bile duct is blocked by a tumor, the bilirubin cannot pass through normally. Blockage may cause the level of bilirubin in the blood, stool, or urine to become very high. High bilirubin levels can result from cancer or from noncancerous conditions. CT scan (Computed tomography) -- An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures. The x-ray machine is shaped like a donut with a large hole. The patient lies on a bed that passes through the hole. As the bed moves slowly through the hole, the machine takes many x-rays. The computer puts the x-rays together to create pictures of the pancreas and other organs and blood vessels in the abdomen. Ultrasonography -- The ultrasound device uses sound waves that cannot be heard by humans. The sound waves produce a pattern of echoes as they bounce off internal organs. The echoes create a picture of the pancreas and other organs inside the abdomen. The echoes from tumors are different from echoes made by healthy tissues.\nThe ultrasound procedure may use an external or internal device, or both types: Transabdominal ultrasound: To make images of the pancreas, the doctor places the ultrasound device on the abdomen and slowly moves it around. EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound): The doctor passes a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. At the tip of the endoscope is an ultrasound device. The doctor slowly withdraws the endoscope from the intestine toward the stomach to make images of the pancreas and surrounding organs and tissues.\nERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) -- The doctor passes an endoscope through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. The doctor slips a smaller tube (catheter) through the endoscope into the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. After injecting dye through the catheter into the ducts, the doctor takes x-ray pictures. The x-rays can show whether the ducts are narrowed or blocked by a tumor or other condition. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography) -- A dye is injected through a thin needle inserted through the skin into the liver. Unless there is a blockage, the dye should move freely through the bile ducts. The dye makes the bile ducts show up on x-ray pictures. From the pictures, the doctor can tell whether there is a blockage from a tumor or other condition. Biopsy -- In some cases, the doctor may remove tissue. A pathologist then uses a microscope to look for cancer cells in the tissue. The doctor may obtain tissue in several ways. One way is by inserting a needle into the pancreas to remove cells. This is called fine-needle aspiration. The doctor uses x-ray or ultrasound to guide the needle. Sometimes the doctor obtains a sample of tissue during EUS or ERCP. Another way is to open the abdomen during an operation."

        "output": "The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.\nWhen calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney. When the calcium level returns to normal, parathyroid hormone production slows down.\nThere are two main types of Parathyroid adenoma.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is caused by enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. This leads to too much parathyroid hormone, which raises the level of calcium in the blood. The term \"hyperparathyroidism\" generally refers to primary hyperparathyroidism.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is when the body produces extra parathyroid hormone because the calcium levels are too low. This is seen when vitamin D levels are low or when calcium is not absorbed from the intestines. Correcting the calcium level and the underlying problem will bring the parathyroid levels in the normal range.\nIf the parathyroid glands continue to produce too much parathyroid hormone even though the calcium level is back to normal, the condition is called \"tertiary hyperthyroidism.\" It occurs especially in patients with kidney problems"

Infection and inflammation spreads from the gums (gingiva) to the ligaments and bone that support the teeth. Loss of support causes the teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. Periodontitis is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. This disorder is uncommon in childhood but increases during adolescence.\nPlaque and tartar build up at the base of the teeth. Inflammation causes a pocket to develop between the gums and the teeth, which fills with plaque and tartar. Soft tissue swelling traps the plaque in the pocket. Continued inflammation leads to damage of the tissues and bone surrounding the tooth. Because plaque contains bacteria, infection is likely and a tooth abscess may also develop, which increases the rate of bone destruction."

To provide vitamin B12 to your blood cells, you need to eat enough foods containing vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. To absorb vitamin B12, your body uses a special protein called intrinsic factor, which is released by cells in the stomach. The combination of vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine.\nWhen the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12.\nVery rarely, infants and children are born without the ability to produce enough intrinsic factor, or the ability to absorb the combination of intrinsic factor and vitamin B12 in the small intestine. Pernicious anemia that occurs at birth (congenital) is inherited. You need the defective gene from each parent to get it.\nCommon causes of pernicious anemia include:\nWeakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis) The body's immune system attacking the cells that make intrinsic factor (autoimmunity against gastric parietal cells) or intrinsic factor itself\nThe disease begins slowly and may take decades to fully establish. Although the congenital form occurs in children, pernicious anemia usually does not appear before age 30 in adults. The average age at diagnosis is 60."

This is called a previa.\nThere are different forms of placenta previa:\nMarginal: The placenta is against the cervix but does not cover the opening. Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening. Complete: The placenta completely covers the cervical opening.\nPlacenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies.\nIt is more common in women who have:\nAbnormally developed uterus Many previous pregnancies Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.) Scarring of the uterine wall caused by previous pregnancies, cesareans, uterine surgery, or abortions\nWomen who smoke or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk.\nPossible causes of placenta previa include:\nAbnormal formation of the placenta Abnormal uterus Large placenta Scarred lining of the uterus (endometrium)"

In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.\nThe most common pneumonia-causing germ in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in people whose immune system is impaired (due to AIDS or certain medications that suppress the immune system). Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae are other bacteria that can cause pneumonia.

Brain or spinal cord involvement is a medical emergency that may result in paralysis or death (usually from respiratory difficulties). Disability is more common than death.

        "input": "What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome?",
        "output": "The cause of PCOS is unknown. Most researchers think that more than one factor could play a role in developing PCOS. Genes are thought to be one factor. Women with PCOS tend to have a mother or sister with PCOS. Researchers also think insulin could be linked to PCOS. Insulin is a hormone that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store. For many women with PCOS, their bodies have problems using insulin so that too much insulin is in the body. Excess insulin appears to increase production of androgen. This hormone is made in fat cells, the ovaries, and the adrenal gland. Levels of androgen that are higher than normal can lead to acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and problems with ovulation.\n<figure-inline class=\"mw-default-size\"> </figure-inline>\nWhat causes the symptoms of PCOS? The ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman's uterus. A woman's ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs also are called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one matures fully. As this one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release it. The egg then travels through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.\nIn women with PCOS, the ovary doesn't make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. Follicles may start to grow and build up fluid. But no one follicle becomes large enough. Instead, some follicles may remain as cysts. Since no follicle becomes large enough and no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made. Without progesterone, a woman's menstrual cycle is irregular or absent. Plus, the cysts make male hormones, which also prevent ovulation."

        "output": "Talk with your doctor if you have irregular, scant or no menstrual periods, are overweight, and have acne or excess facial hair growth.\nIt appears to be higher rates of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia), and premature delivery in women with PCOS. Researchers are studying how the diabetes medicine metformin can prevent or reduce the chances of having these problems while pregnant.\nWomen with PCOS have greater chances of developing several serious, life-threatening diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Recent studies found that:\nMore than 50 percent of women with PCOS will have diabetes or pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) before the age of 40. Women with PCOS have a four to seven times higher risk of heart attack than women of the same age without PCOS. Women with PCOS are at greater risk of having hypertension. Women with PCOS have high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol.\nThe chance of getting endometrial cancer is another concern for women with PCOS. Irregular menstrual periods and the absence of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not the hormone progesterone. Progesterone causes the endometrium to shed its lining each month as a menstrual period. Without progesterone, the endometrium becomes thick, which can cause heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding. Over time, this can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, when the lining grows too much, and cancer."

The bacteria species associated with TBRF are Borrelia duttoni, Borrelia hermsii, and Borrelia parkerii. Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted by body lice and is most common in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. The bacteria species associated with LBRF is Borrelia recurrentis.\nSudden fever occurs within 2 weeks of infection. In LBRF, the fever usually lasts 3-6 days and is usually followed by a single, milder episode. In TRBF, multiple episodes of fever occur and each may last up to 3 days. Individuals may be free of fever for up to 2 weeks before it returns.\nIn both forms, the fever episode may end in \"crisis.\" This consists of shaking chills, followed by intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure. This stage may result in death in up to 10% of people.\nAfter several cycles of fever, some people may develop dramatic central nervous system signs such as seizures, stupor, and coma. The Borrelia organism may also invade heart and liver tissues, causing inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and liver (hepatitis). Widespread bleeding and pneumonia are other complications."

In the mountains of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, infections are usually caused by Borrelia hermsii and are often acquired in cabins in forests. It is possible that the risk now extends into the southeastern United States.\nLBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan. Famine, war, and the movement and groups of refugees often result in epidemics of LBRF. The largest recent epidemics of LBRF occurred during World Wars I and II.

This causes separation of the retina from the underlying tissues.\nRetinal detachment often occurs on its own without an underlying cause. However, it may also be caused by trauma, diabetes, or an inflammatory disorder. It is most often caused by a related condition called posterior vitreous detachment.\nThe risk factors are previous eye surgery, nearsightedness, a family history of retinal detachment, uncontrolled diabetes, and trauma."

With modern therapy, over 90 percent of those with a retinal detachment can be successfully treated, although sometimes a second treatment is needed. However, the final visual outcome is not always predictable and may not be known for up to several months following surgery. Even under the best of circumstances, and even after multiple attempts at repair, treatment sometimes fails and vision may eventually be lost.\nVisual results are best if the retinal detachment is repaired before the macula (the center region of the retina responsible for fine, detailed vision) detaches. That is why it is important to contact an eye care professional immediately if you see a sudden or gradual increase in the number of floaters and/or light flashes, or a dark curtain over the field of vision."

        "output": "Rett syndrome occurs almost exclusively in girls and may be misdiagnosed as autism or cerebral palsy.\nStudies have linked many Rett syndrome cases to a defect in the methl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. This gene is on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so even when one has this significant defect, the other X chromosome is normal enough for the child to survive.\nMales born with this defective gene do not have a second X chromosome to make up for the problem. Therefore, the defect usually results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or very early death.\nThe condition affects about 1 out of 10,000 children.

For example, seizures or breathing problems tend to lessen in late adolescence.\nDevelopmental regression or delays vary. Usually, a child with Rett syndrome sits up properly but may not crawl. For those who do crawl, many do so by scooting on their tummy without using their hands.\nSimilarly, some children walk independently within the normal age range, while others are delayed, don't learn to walk independently at all, or don't learn to walk until late childhood or early adolescence. For those children who do learn to walk at the normal time, some keep that ability for their lifetime, while other children lose the skill.\nLife expectancies are not well studied, although survival at least until the mid-20s is likely. The average life expectancy of a girl with Rett syndrome may be mid-40s. Death is often related to seizure, aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and accidents."

        "input": "What causes Rh incompatibility?",
        "output": "During pregnancy, red blood cells from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's bloodstream through the placenta.\nIf the mother is Rh-negative, her immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as if they were a foreign substance and makes antibodies against the fetal blood cells. These anti-Rh antibodies may cross back through the placenta into the developing baby and destroy the baby's circulating red blood cells.\nWhen red blood cells are broken down, they make bilirubin. This causes an infant to become yellow (jaundiced). The level of bilirubin in the infant's bloodstream may range from mild to dangerously high.\nBecause it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies, first born infants are often not affected unless the mother had past miscarriages or abortions that sensitized her immune system. However, all children she has afterwards who are also Rh-positive may be affected.\nRh incompatibility develops only when the mother is Rh-negative and the infant is Rh-positive. Thanks to the use of special immune globulins called RhoGHAM, this problem has become uncommon in the United States and other places that provide access to good prenatal care."

It swims freely in open bodies of water.\nOn contact with humans, the parasite burrows into the skin, matures into another stage (schistosomula), then migrates to the lungs and liver, where it matures into the adult form.\nThe adult worm then migrates to its preferred body part, depending on its species. These areas include the bladder, rectum, intestines, liver, portal venous system (the veins that carry blood from the intestines to liver), spleen, and lungs.\nSchistosomiasis is not usually seen in the United States. It is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide."

They account for approximately 8 percent of all tumors inside the skull; one out of every 100,000 individuals per year develops a vestibular schwannoma. Symptoms may develop at any age but usually occur between the age s of 30 and 60 years. Unilateral vestibular schwannoma s are not hereditary.\nBilateral vestibular schwannoma s affect both hearing nerve s and are usually associated with a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). Half of affected individuals have inherited the disorder from an affected parent and half seem to have a mutation for the first time in their family. Each child of an affected parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Unlike those with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma, individuals with NF2 usually develop symptoms in their teens or early adulthood. In addition, patients with NF2 usually develop multiple brain and spinal cord related tumors. They also can develop tumors of the nerves important for swallowing, speech, eye and facial movement, and facial sensation. Determining the best management of the vestibular schwannoma s as well as the additional nerve, brain, and spinal cord tumors is more complicated than deciding how to treat a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Further research is needed to determine the best treatment for individuals with NF2."

        "input": "Who is at highest risk for Schwannoma ?",
        "output": "Scientists believe that both unilateral and bilateral vestibular schwannomas form following the loss of the function of a gene on chromosome 22. (A gene is a small section of DNA responsible for a particular characteristic like hair color or skin tone). Scientists believe that this particular gene on chromosome 22 produces a protein that controls the growth of Schwann cells. When this gene malfunctions, Schwann cell growth is uncontrolled, resulting in a tumor. Scientists also think that this gene may help control the growth of other types of tumors. In neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, the faulty gene on chromosome 22 is inherited. For individuals with unilateral vestibular schwannoma, however, some scientists hypothesize that this gene somehow loses its ability to function properly.\nThese tumors are thought to occur when there is a defect in a gene that normally prevents tumors from forming. The cause of the genetic defect is not known. However, acoustic neuroma is often linked with the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).\nAcoustic neuromas are relatively uncommon, but they are one of the most common types of brain tumors.\nThe tumor is usually found at the base of the brain."

PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.\nWhen calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney.\nMedical conditions that cause low blood calcium levels or interfere with the body's ability to break down and remove phosphate can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Too much phosphate causes changes in calcium levels.\nKidney failure is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Kidney failure can interfere with the body's ability to remove phosphate.\nOther causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism may include:\nCalcium deficiency\nNot enough calcium in the diet Too much calcium loss in the urine\nConditions that make it hard for the body to break down phosphate, including:\nAluminum poisoning Certain types of cancer Kidney disease Malnutrition Malabsorption\nVitamin D disorders (often seen in children with malnutrition and older adults who do not get enough sunlight):\nProblems absorbing vitamin D into the body (malabsorption) Problems breaking down vitamin D (due to the use of certain drugs) Rickets Too little vitamin D (deficiency)"

        "output": "As infants develop, they experience various emotions, usually in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they have little knowledge of what is ordinary and what may be dangerous, so new situations or experiences seem usual, and not frightening.\nIn normal development, during this early period the infant becomes familiar with the home environment, and feels comfortable when parents or other known caretakers are present. After this time, lack of familiarity often produces fear because the infant recognizes that something unusual is going on.\nFrom 8 - 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe.\nSeparation anxiety is a normal developmental stage. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master their environment.\nIt usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. There is also a normal desire to test their independence.\nTo get over separation anxiety, children must:\nFeel safe in their home environment Trust people other than their parents Trust that their parents will return\nEven after children have successfully mastered this developmental stage, separation anxiety may return during periods of stress. Most children will experience some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, especially when separated from their parents.\nWhen children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are experiencing stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. When parents cannot be with their children in these situations, the children experience distress.\nThis is why it is important to stay with your child as much as is possible during any medical procedures. Your presence can actually reduce the amount of pain the child experiences, as anxiety of any kind makes pain worse."

You can catch SARS if you breathe in or touch these particles. The SARS virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to 6 hours in these droplets and up to 3 hours after the droplets have dried.\nWhile droplet transmission through close contact was responsible for most of the early cases of SARS, evidence began to mount that SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets had touched. Airborne transmission was a real possibility in some cases. Live virus had even been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to four days. And the virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.\nWith other coronaviruses, re-infection (becoming infected and falling ill again) is common. Preliminary reports suggest that this may also be the case with SARS.\nSymptoms usually occur about 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus, although there have been some cases where the illness started considerably sooner or later. Those with active symptoms of illness are clearly contagious, but it is not known how long a person may be contagious before or after symptoms."

Hemoglobin S changes the shape of red blood cells, especially when the cells are exposed to low oxygen levels. The red blood cells become shaped like crescents or sickles. The fragile, sickle-shaped cells deliver less oxygen to the body's tissues. They can also get stuck more easily in small blood vessels, and break into pieces that interupt healthy blood flow.\nSickle cell anemia is inherited from both parents. If you inherit the hemoglobin S gene from one parent and normal hemoglobin (A) from your other parent, you will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia. In order to get sickle cell disease, both of your parents must have at least 1 defective gene. If both of your parents have sickle cell trait, then there is a 25% chance that you will get sickle cell disease."

Silica is a main part of sand, so glass workers and sand-blasters are also exposed to silica.\nThree types of silicosis exist:\nSimple chronic silicosis -- results from long-term exposure (more than 20 years) to low amounts of silica dust. Swellings caused by the silica dust form in the lungs and chest lymph nodes. This disease may cause people to have trouble breathing.\nAccelerated silicosis -- occurs after exposure to larger amounts of silica over a shorter period of time (5 - 15 years). Swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in simple silicosis.\nAcute silicosis -- results from short-term exposure to very large amounts of silica. The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.\nProgressive massive fibrosis can occur in either simple or accelerated silicosis, but is more common in the accelerated form. Progressive massive fibrosis is caused by severe scarring and destroys normal lung structures.\nIntense exposure to silica can cause disease within a year, but it usually takes at least 10 - 15 years of exposure before symptoms occur. Silicosis has become less common since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created regulations requiring the use of protective equipment, which limits the amount of silica dust workers inhale."

        "output": "African trypanosomiasis symptoms occur in two stages. The first stage is known as the haemo-lymphatic phase and is characterized by fever, headaches, and joint pains, and itching. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic system by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and kidney dysfunctions. The second stage, called the neurological phase, begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood-brain barrier. The term'sleeping sickness' comes from the symptoms of the neurological phase. The symptoms include confusion, reduced coordination, and disruption of the sleep cycle, with bouts of fatigue punctuated with manic periods leading to daytime slumber and night-time insomnia. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma and death. Damage caused in the neurological phase can be irreversible.\nGeneral symptoms include:\nAnxiety Drowsiness Fever Headache Increased sleepiness Insomnia at night Mood changes Sweating Swollen lymph nodes all over the body Swollen, red, painful nodule at site of fly bite Uncontrollable urge to sleep"

When the infection spreads to the central nervous system, it causes the symptoms typical of sleeping sickness. When it reaches the brain, behavioral changes such as fear and mood swings occur, followed by a headache, fever, and weakness. Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may develop. In addition to the bite of the tsetse fly, the disease can be transmitted in the following ways:\nMother to child infection: the trypanosome can sometimes cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Laboratories: accidental infections, for example, through the handling of blood of an infected person and organ transplantation, although this is uncommon.

So, if you have those symptoms, you had better go to see your doctor to do some tests. They include lab tests, image tests and endoscopy.\nCapsule endoscopy: In this procedure, the patient is not detected with an actual endoscope but with a capsule (about the size of a large vitamin pill) which contains a light source and a very small camera. After swallowed, the capsule goes through the small intestine for a period of 8 hours. It takes thousands of pictures which can be downloaded onto a computer for the doctor to analyze. Double balloon enteroscopy and biopsy: This is a newer way of looking at the small intestine. At first the patient need to anesthesia. This technology makes the doctor to see the intestine a foot at a time and even take a biopsy if something abnormal. Barium x-rays: This is an x-ray test that a person is given a medication that will temporarily slow bowel movement, so structures can be more easily seen on the x-rays. For this test, the patient drinks a millkshake-like substance called barium. X-ray method called fluroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken in a variety of positions. It includes upper GI series, enteroclysis and a barium enema. Computed tomography (CT) scan: CT scans are often used to diagnose small intestine cancer. It can confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs near the small intestine, as well as lymph nodes and distant organs where the cancer might have spread.

        "output": "Normally, during the first month of a pregnancy, the two sides of the spine (or backbone) join together to cover the spinal cord, spinal nerves and meninges (the tissues covering the spinal cord). Spina bifida refers to any birth defect involving incomplete closure of the spine.\nMyelomeningocele is the most common type of spina bifida. It is a neural tube defect in which the bones of the spine do not completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. This causes the spinal cord and meninges (the tissues covering the spinal cord) to stick out of the child's back.\nMyelomeningocele may affect as many as 1 out of every 800 infants.\nThe rest of spina bifida cases are most commonly:\nSpina bifida occulta, a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close but the spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect Meningoceles, a condition where the tissue covering the spinal cord sticks out of the spinal defect but the spinal cord remains in place.\nOther congenital disorders or birth defects may also be present in a child with myelomeningocele. Hydrocephalus may affect as many as 90% of children with myelomeningocele. Other disorders of the spinal cord or musculoskeletal system may be seen, including syringomyelia and hip dislocation.\nThe cause of myelomeningocele is unknown. However, low levels of folic acid in a woman's body before and during early pregnancy is thought to play a part in this type of birth defect. The vitamin folic acid (or folate) is important for brain and spinal cord development.\nAlso, if a child is born with myelomeningocele, future children in that family have a higher risk than the general population. However, in many cases, there is no family connection.\nSome theorize that a virus make play a role, since there is a higher rate of this condition in children born in the early winter months.

In some cases, the pain is severe enough that you are unable to move. You may also have numbness.\nThe pain most often occurs on one side of the body.\nWith a lumbar (lower back) herniated disc, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip, or buttocks and numbness in other parts. You may also feel the sensations on the back of the calf or sole of the foot. The affected leg may feel weak. With a cervical (neck) disc herniation, you may have pain when moving your neck, deep pain near or over the shoulder blade, or pain that radiates to the upper arm, forearm, or (rarely) fingers.\nThe pain often starts slowly. It may get worse:\nAfter standing or sitting At night When sneezing, coughing, or laughing When bending backwards or walking more than a few yards, especially if it is caused by spinal stenosis\nYou may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your doctor examines you.

        "input": "What causes Spinal disc herniation?",
        "output": "The bones (vertebrae) of the spinal column run down the back, connecting the skull to the pelvis. These bones protect nerves that come out of the brain and travel down your back, forming the spinal cord. Nerve roots are large nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and leave your spinal column between each vertebrae.\nThe spinal vertebrae are separated by discs filled with a soft, gelatinous substance. These discs cushion the spinal column and space between your vertebrae. These discs may herniate (move out of place) or rupture from trauma or strain. When this happens, the spinal nerves may become compressed, resulting in pain, numbness, or weakness. The lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area for a slipped disc. The cervical (neck) discs are affected 8% of the time. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) discs are rarely involved.\nRadiculopathy refers to any disease that affects the spinal nerve roots. A herniated disc is one cause of radiculopathy (sciatica).\nDisc herniation occurs more frequently in middle-aged and older men, especially those involved in strenuous physical activity. Other risk factors include any conditions present at birth (congenital) that affect the size of the lumbar spinal canal."

Herniated discs are most common in middle age, especially between 35 and 45, due to aging-related degeneration of the discs. Smoking. Smoking tobacco increases your risk of disc herniation because it decreases oxygen levels in your blood, depriving your body tissues of vital nutrients. Weight. Excess body weight causes extra stress on the discs in your lower back. Height. Being tall increases your risk of disc herniation. Men taller than 5 feet 11 inches (180 centimeters) and women taller than 5 feet 7 inches (170 centimeters) appear to have a greater risk of a herniated disc. Occupations that strain your spine. People with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of back problems. Repetitive lifting, pulling, pushing, bending sideways and twisting also may increase your risk of a herniated disc. Jobs that require prolonged sitting or standing in one position also may increase your risk of disc herniation."

It is typically a relatively mild pain. With the development of the cancer, abdominal pain may be persistent. Loss of appetite - Some patients endure a loss of appetite without any inducement. Nausea and vomiting - This is also because of the affect of the lump. It disturbs the normal digestive functions. Vomiting blood - Sometimes a massive hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract may occur. Vague abdominal fullness - This is because of the development of the lump. Premature abdominal fullness after meals: This is induced by the decreased amount of gastric space with the growth of the lump.\nAbdominal lump - People can not find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the cancer enlarges, the lump may be obvious in the abdomen.\nWhole body symptoms\nGeneral decline in health- This is because of the consumption of the cancer. Weakness or fatigue - The reason is also because the cancer wastes your energy.\nInfections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell his/her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.\nAbdominal and whole body symptoms have no specificity.

        "output": "The outlook following a subdural hematoma varies widely depending on the type and location of head injury, the size of the blood collection, and how quickly treatment is obtained.\nAcute subdural hematomas present the greatest challenge, with high rates of death and injury. Subacute and chronic subdural hematomas have better outcomes in most cases, with symptoms often going away after the blood collection is drained. A period of rehabilitation is sometimes needed to assist the person back to his or her usual level of functioning.\nThere is a high frequency of seizures following a subdural hematoma, even after drainage, but these are usually well controlled with medication. Seizures may occur at the time the hematoma forms, or up to months or years afterward."

        "output": "Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with swine flu have occurred. Most commonly, these cases occur in persons with direct exposure to pigs (e.g. children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). In addition, there have been documented cases of one person spreading swine flu to others. For example, an outbreak of apparent swine flu infection in pigs in Wisconsin in 1988 resulted in multiple human infections, and, although no community outbreak resulted, there was antibody evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care workers who had close contact with the patient."

        "output": "Influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from pigs to people and from people to pigs. Human infection with flu viruses from pigs are most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs. Human-to-human transmission of swine flu can also occur. This is thought to occur in the same way as seasonal flu occurs in people, which is mainly person-to-person transmission through coughing or sneezing of people infected with the influenza virus. People may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose."

        "output": "Probably the most well known is an outbreak of swine flu among soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey in 1976. The virus caused disease with x-ray evidence of pneumonia in at least 4 soldiers and 1 death; all of these patients had previously been healthy. The virus was transmitted to close contacts in a basic training environment, with limited transmission outside the basic training group. The virus is thought to have circulated for a month and disappeared. The source of the virus, the exact time of its introduction into Fort Dix, and factors limiting its spread and duration are unknown. The Fort Dix outbreak may have been caused by introduction of an animal virus into a stressed human population in close contact in crowded facilities during the winter. The swine influenza A virus collected from a Fort Dix soldier was named A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1)."

This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.\nSyphilis occurs worldwide. Syphilis is more common in urban areas, and the number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 - 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.\nBecause people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).\nSyphilis has three stages:\nPrimary syphilis Secondary syphilis Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)\nSecondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:\nFree, government-sponsored sexually transmitted disease clinics Screening tests for syphilis Public education about STDs Prenatal screening"

About 8,000 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer, and about 390 men die of this disease each year. Testicular cancer occurs most often in men between the ages of 20 and 39, and is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 34. It is most common in white men, especially those of Scandinavian descent. The testicular cancer rate has more than doubled among white men in the past 40 years, but has only recently begun to increase among black men. The reason for the racial differences in incidence is not known.\nThe exact causes of testicular cancer are not known. However, studies have shown that several factors increase a man's chance of developing this disease.\nUndescended testicle (cryptorchidism): Normally, the testicles descend from inside the abdomen into the scrotum before birth. The risk of testicular cancer is increased in males with a testicle that does not move down into the scrotum. This risk does not change even after surgery to move the testicle into the scrotum. The increased risk applies to both testicles. Congenital abnormalities: Men born with abnormalities of the testicles, penis, or kidneys, as well as those with inguinal hernia (hernia in the groin area, where the thigh meets the abdomen), may be at increased risk. History of testicular cancer: Men who have had testicular cancer are at increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle.

Men who have had testicular cancer should see their doctor regularly and should report any unusual symptoms right away. Follow-up varies for different types and stages of testicular cancer. Generally, patients are checked frequently by their doctor and have regular blood tests to measure tumor marker levels. They also have regular x-rays and computed tomography, also called CT scans or CAT scans (detailed pictures of areas inside the body created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine). Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased likelihood of developing cancer in the remaining testicle. Patients treated with chemotherapy may have an increased risk of certain types of leukemia, as well as other types of cancer. Regular follow-up care ensures that changes in health are discussed and that problems are treated as soon as possible.\nMen with testicular cancer should discuss their concerns about sexual function and fertility with their doctor. It is important to know that men with testicular cancer often have fertility problems even before their cancer is treated. If a man has pre-existing fertility problems, or if he is to have treatment that might lead to infertility, he may want to ask the doctor about sperm banking (freezing sperm before treatment for use in the future).

        "output": "Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails, but this concept is somewhat misleading. Objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors, or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria, but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more C. tetani bacteria. The rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for a C. tetani endospore to reside, and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospore into the wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Because C. tetani is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores survive well in an environment that lacks oxygen. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment is provided by the same object which causes a puncture wound, delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth."

These are malignant and tend to spread rapidly.\nSmoking and other tobacco use are associated with 70 - 80% of oral cancer cases. Smoke and heat from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth. Use of chewing tobacco or snuff causes irritation from direct contact with the mucous membranes. Heavy alcohol use is another activity associated with increased risk for oral cancer.\nOther factors that increase the risk of oral cancer include poor dental and oral hygiene and chronic irritation (such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings). Some oral cancers begin as a white plaque (leukoplakia) or as a mouth ulcer. Recently, infection with HPV (human papilloma virus) has beeen shown to be a risk factor.\nOral cancer accounts for about 8% of all malignant growths.

        "output": "Transverse myelitis may be either acute (developing over hours to several days) or subacute (usually developing over 1 to 4 weeks). Initial symptoms usually include:\nLocalized lower back pain Sudden paresthesias (abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling) in the legs, sensory loss, and paraparesis (partial paralysis of the legs) Paraparesis may progress to paraplegia (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk) Urinary bladder and bowel dysfunction is common.\nMany patients also report experiencing muscle spasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite. Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients may experience respiratory problems as well.\nInitially, people with transverse myelitis may notice that they are stumbling or dragging one foot or that their legs seem heavier than normal. Coordination of hand and arm movements, as well as arm and hand strength may also be compromised. Progression of the disease leads to full paralysis of the legs, requiring the patient to use a wheelchair.\nPain is the primary presenting symptom of transverse myelitis in approximately one-third to one-half of all patients. The pain may be localized in the lower back or may consist of sharp, shooting sensations that radiate down the legs or arms or around the torso.\nPatients who experience sensory disturbances often use terms such as numbness, tingling, coldness, or burning to describe their symptoms. Up to 80 percent of those with transverse myelitis report areas of heightened sensitivity to touch, such that clothing or a light touch with a finger causes significant discomfort or pain (a condition called allodynia). Many also experience heightened sensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.\nBladder and bowel problems may involve increased frequency of the urge to urinate or have bowel movements, incontinence, difficulty voiding, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and constipation. Over the course of the disease, the majority of people with transverse myelitis will experience one or several of these symptoms."

        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What causes Transverse myelitis?",
        "output": "Researchers are uncertain of the exact causes of transverse myelitis. The inflammation that causes such extensive damage to nerve fibers of the spinal cord may result from viral infections or abnormal immune reactions. Transverse myelitis also may occur as a complication of syphilis, measles, Lyme disease, and some vaccinations, including those for chickenpox and rabies. Cases in which a cause cannot be identified are called idiopathic.\nTransverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agents suspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections (otitis media), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (bacterial pneumonia) have also been associated with the condition.\nIn post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms, rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an important role in causing damage to spinal nerves. Although researchers have not yet identified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases, stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that an autoimmune reaction may be responsible. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body\u2019s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damage to myelin within the spinal cord.\nBecause some affected individuals also have autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and sarcoidosis, some scientists suggest that transverse myelitis may also be an autoimmune disorder. In addition, some cancers may trigger an abnormal immune response that may lead to transverse myelitis."

A peak in incidence rates (the number of new cases per year) appears to occur between 10 and 19 years and 30 and 39 years. Although only a few studies have examined incidence rates, it is estimated that about 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed each year in the United States, and approximately 33,000 Americans have some type of disability resulting from the disorder."

        "output": "Recovery from transverse myelitis usually begins within 2 to 12 weeks of the onset of symptoms and may continue for up to 2 years. However, if there is no improvement within the first 3 to 6 months, significant recovery is unlikely. About one-third of people affected with transverse myelitis experience good or full recovery from their symptoms; they regain the ability to walk normally and experience minimal urinary or bowel effects and paresthesias. Another one-third show only fair recovery and are left with significant deficits such as spastic gait, sensory dysfunction, and prominent urinary urgency or incontinence. The remaining one-third show no recovery at all, remaining wheelchair-bound or bedridden with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living. Unfortunately, making predictions about individual cases is difficult. However, research has shown that a rapid onset of symptoms generally results in poorer recovery outcomes.\nThe majority of people with this disorder experience only one episode although in rare cases recurrent or relapsing transverse myelitis does occur. Some patients recover completely, then experience a relapse. Others begin to recover, then suffer worsening of symptoms before recovery continues. In all cases of relapse, physicians will evaluate possible underlying causes such as MS, NMO, or systemic lupus erythematosus since most people who experience relapse have an identifiable underlying disorder. People with a recurrent relapsing disorder will usually require some type of ongoing therapy that modulates or suppresses the immune system. The propose of such therapies is to reduce the chance of future relapses."

Rickettsia typhi causes murine or endemic typhus. Endemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called \"jail fever.\" Murine typhus occurs in the southeastern and southern United States, often during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. Risk factors for murine typhus include:\nExposure to rat fleas or rat feces Exposure to other animals (such as cats, opossums, raccoons, skunks, and rats)\nRickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus and Brill-Zinsser disease. Brill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the disease re-activates in a person who was previously infected. It is more common in the elderly. Lice and fleas of flying squirrels spread the bacteria."

        "output": "The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.\nThe liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.\nSeveral inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.\nThese diseases include:\nArgininosuccinic aciduria Arginase deficiency Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency Citrullinemia N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS) Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)\nAs a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns.

Abnormal estrogen levels may be the most important indicator.\nHormone levels: Any change in the balance of estrogen and progesterone that leads to the production of more estrogen increases the risk for developing endometrial cancer.\nEstrogen therapy: Clinical data shows the use of estrogen without progesterone can lead to endometrial cancer.\nBirth control pills: Clinical observations suggest that the use of birth control pills can lower the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTotal number of menstrual cycles: Medical studies show that more menstrual cycles during a woman\u2019s lifetime raises her risk of endometrial cancer.\nPregnancy: Studies show that a higher number of pregnancies may protect against endometrial cancer because of the the shift towards more progesterone during the pregnancy period.\nObesity: Besides ovaries, estrogen can also be produced by fat tissue. So, women with more fat tissue in their bodies have higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. After menopause, estrogen produced by the fat tissue has a larger influence than it did before menopause.\nTamoxifen: As a drug used to treat chest cancer, Tamoxifen effects the tissue in the chest and the tissue in the uterus very differently. It promotes the grow of the endometrium and increases the risk of endometrial cancer.\nOvarian tumors: The granulosa-theca cell tumor, one type of ovarian tumor, can produce estrogen and increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome: This is a condition with abnormal hormone levels, such as higher estrogen levels and lower levels of progesterone. This can also increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nA diet high in animal fat\nEndometrial hyperplasia: Atypical hyperplasia is a precancerous lesion of endometrial cancer.\nPrior pelvic radiation therapy: Radiation can increase the risk of endometrial cancer by damaging the DNA of cells.\nDiabetes: Epidemiological data shows that endometrial cancer may be as much as four times more common in women with diabetes.\nFamily history: Clinical survey's show peeople with a family history of endometrial cancer have a higher risk of developing the disease.\nAge: The risk of endometrial cancer increases as women become older."

        "input": "What causes Vaginitis?",
        "output": "Vulvovaginitis can affect women of all ages and is extremely common. It can be caused by bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and other parasites. Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also cause vulvovaginitis, as can various chemicals found in bubble baths, soaps, and perfumes. Environmental factors such as poor hygiene and allergens may also cause this condition. Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vulvovaginitis in women of all ages. Antibiotic use can lead to yeast infections by killing the normal antifungal bacteria that live in the vagina. Yeast infections typically cause genital itching and a thick, white vaginal discharge, and other symptoms.\nAnother cause of vulvovaginitis is bacterial vaginosis, an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis may cause a thin, grey vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. An STI called trichomonas vaginitis infection is another common cause. This infection leads to genital itching, a vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge, which may be yellow-grey or green in color.\nBubble baths, soaps, vaginal contraceptives, feminine sprays, and perfumes can cause irritating itchy rashes in the genital area, while tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing sometimes cause heat rashes. Irritated tissue is more susceptible to infection than normal tissue, and many infection-causing organisms thrive in environments that are warm, damp, and dark. Not only can these factors contribute to the cause of vulvovaginitis, they frequently prolong the recovery period. A lack of estrogen in postmenopausal women can result in vaginal dryness and thinning of vaginal and vulvar skin, which may also lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. Some skin conditions can cause itching and chronic irritation of the vulvar area. Foreign bodies, such as lost tampons, can also cause vulvar irritation and itching and strong smelling discharge. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis (where specific cause cannot be identified) can be seen in all age groups, but it occurs most commonly in young girls before puberty. Once puberty begins, the vagina becomes more acidic, which tends to help prevent infections. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis can occur in girls with poor genital hygiene and is characterized by a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening. This condition is often associated with an overgrowth of a type of bacteria that is typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the bathroom. Sexual abuse should be considered in children with unusual infections and recurrent episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the organism that causes gonorrhea, produces gonococcal vulvovaginitis in young girls who have sexual exposure. Gonorrhea-related vaginitis is considered a sexually transmitted illness. If lab tests confirm this diagnosis, young girls should be evaluated for sexual abuse."

In some cases, your genes or family history may also play a role. Not all persons with diabetes develop this condition. Each kidney is made of hundreds of thousands of filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron has a cluster of tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus. Together these structures help remove waste from the body. Too much blood sugar can damage these structures, causing them to thicken and become scarred. Slowly, over time, more and more blood vessels are destroyed. The kidney structures begin to leak and protein (albumin) begins to pass into the urine. Diabetic nephropathy generally goes along with other diabetes complications including hypertension, retinopathy, and blood vessel changes."

Controlling blood sugar levels reduces this risk.\nHigh blood sugar (glucose) levels often go back to normal after delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth and at regular doctor's appointments to screen for signs of diabetes.

This may be related to an increase in total body potassium or the excess release of potassium from the cells into the bloodstream.\nThe kidneys normally remove excess potassium from the body. Most cases of hyperkalemia are caused by disorders that reduce the kidneys' ability to get rid of potassium.This may result from disorders such as:\nAcute kidney failure Chronic kidney failure Glomerulonephritis Obstructive uropathy Rejection of a kidney transplant\nThe hormone aldosterone regulates kidney removal of sodium and potassium. Lack of aldosterone can result in hyperkalemia with an increase in total body potassium. Addison's disease is one disorder that causes reduced aldosterone production.\nAny time potassium is released from the cells, it may build up in the fluid outside the cells and in the bloodstream. Acidosis leads to the movement of potassium from inside the cells to the fluid outside the cells. Tissue injury can cause the cells to release potassium. Such injury includes:\nBurns Disorders that cause blood cells to burst (hemolytic conditions) Gastrointestinal bleeding Rhabdomyolysis from drugs, alcoholism, coma, or certain infections Surgery Traumatic injury Tumors\nIf the kidney is working properly, and there is enough aldosterone, tissue trauma alone rarely leads to hyperkalemia. A normally functioning kidney will remove the excess potassium that has been released from the cells.\nIncreased intake of potassium can cause hyperkalemia if kidney function is poor. Salt substitutes often contain potassium, as do many \"low-salt\" packaged foods.\nHyperkalemia may be caused by medications, including medications that affect kidney function (potassium sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone, amiloride, or triamterene) and potassium supplements (especially intravenous potassium)."

About half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bones of the spine). Osteoporosis occurs when the body fails to form enough new bone, when too much old bone is reabsorbed by the body or both.\nCalcium and phosphate are two minerals that are essential for normal bone formation. Throughout youth, your body uses these minerals to produce bones. If you do not get enough calcium, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium from the diet, bone production and bone tissues may suffer.\nAs you age, calcium and phosphate may be reabsorbed back into the body from the bones, which makes the bone tissue weaker. This can result in brittle, fragile bones that are more prone to fractures, even without injury. Usually, the loss occurs gradually over years. Many times, a person will have a fracture before becoming aware that the disease is present. By the time a fracture occurs, the disease is in its advanced stages and damage is severe. The leading causes of osteoporosis are a drop in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a drop in testosterone in men. Women over age 50 and men over age 70 have a higher risk for osteoporosis.\nOther causes include: Being confined to a bed Chronic rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, eating disorders Taking corticosteroid medications (prednisone, methylprednisolone) every day for more than 3 months, or taking some antiseizure drugs Hyperparathyroidism Vitamin D deficiency"

This is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. Pain that is localized is found in only one area of your belly. This type of pain is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach. Cramp like pain is usually not serious and is more likely to be due to gas and bloating which is followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with fever. Colicky pain is pain that comes in waves.

Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest food components such as artificial sweeteners and lactose\u2014the sugar found in milk. Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.

Inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea. Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.\nSome people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon after gallbladder surgery.\nPeople who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler\u2019s diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites.

    {
        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "What are the causes of Constipation?",
        "output": "To understand constipation, it helps to know how the colon, or large intestine, works. As food moves through the colon, the colon absorbs water from the food while it forms waste products, or stool. Muscle contractions in the colon then push the stool toward the rectum. By the time stool reaches the rectum it is solid, because most of the water has been absorbed.\nConstipation occurs when the colon absorbs too much water or if the colon\u2019s muscle contractions are slow or sluggish, causing the stool to move through the colon too slowly. As a result, stools can become hard and dry. Common causes of constipation are\nnot enough fiber in the diet lack of physical activity medications milk irritable bowel syndrome changes in life or routine such as pregnancy, aging, and travel abuse of laxatives ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement dehydration specific diseases or conditions, such as stroke (most common) problems with the colon and rectum problems with intestinal function (chronic idiopathic constipation)\nPeople who eat a high-fiber diet are less likely to become constipated. The most common causes of constipation are a diet low in fiber or a diet high in fats, such as cheese, eggs, and meats.\nFiber\u2014both soluble and insoluble\u2014is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Soluble fiber dissolves easily in water and takes on a soft, gel-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes through the intestines almost unchanged. The bulk and soft texture of fiber help prevent hard, dry stools that are difficult to pass.\nAmericans eat an average of 5 to 14 grams of fiber daily,* which is short of the 20 to 35 grams recommended by the American Dietetic Association. Both children and adults often eat too many refined and processed foods from which the natural fiber has been removed.\nA low-fiber diet also plays a key role in constipation among older adults, who may lose interest in eating and choose foods that are quick to make or buy, such as fast foods, or prepared foods, both of which are usually low in fiber. Also, difficulties with chewing or swallowing may cause older people to eat soft foods that are processed and low in fiber.\nNational Center for Health Statistics. Dietary Intake of Macronutrients, Micronutrients, and Other Dietary Constituents: United States, 1988\u201394. Vital and Health Statistics, Series 11, Number 245. July 2002.\nResearch shows that although increased fluid intake does not necessarily help relieve constipation, many people report some relief from their constipation if they drink fluids such as water and juice and avoid dehydration. Liquids add fluid to the colon and bulk to stools, making bowel movements softer and easier to pass. People who have problems with constipation should try to drink liquids every day. However, liquids that contain caffeine, such as coffee and cola drinks will worsen one\u2019s symptoms by causing dehydration. Alcohol is another beverage that causes dehydration. It is important to drink fluids that hydrate the body, especially when consuming caffeine containing drinks or alcoholic beverages.\nA lack of physical activity can lead to constipation, although doctors do not know precisely why. For example, constipation often occurs after an accident or during an illness when one must stay in bed and cannot exercise. Lack of physical activity is thought to be one of the reasons constipation is common in older people.\nSome medications can cause constipation, including\npain medications (especially narcotics) antacids that contain aluminum and calcium blood pressure medications (calcium channel blockers) antiparkinson drugs antispasmodics antidepressants iron supplements diuretics anticonvulsants\nDuring pregnancy, women may be constipated because of hormonal changes or because the uterus compresses the intestine. Aging may also affect bowel regularity, because a slower metabolism results in less intestinal activity and muscle tone. In addition, people often become constipated when traveling, because their normal diet and daily routine are disrupted.\nThe common belief that people must have a daily bowel movement has led to self-medicating with OTC laxative products. Although people may feel relief when they use laxatives, typically they must increase the dose over time because the body grows reliant on laxatives in order to have a bowel movement. As a result, laxatives may become habit-forming. Ignoring the Urge to Have a Bowel Movement\nPeople who ignore the urge to have a bowel movement may eventually stop feeling the need to have one, which can lead to constipation. Some people delay having a bowel movement because they do not want to use toilets outside the home. Others ignore the urge because of emotional stress or because they are too busy. Children may postpone having a bowel movement because of stressful toilet training or because they do not want to interrupt their play.\nDiseases that cause constipation include neurological disorders, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and systemic conditions that affect organ systems. These disorders can slow the movement of stool through the colon, rectum, or anus.\nConditions that can cause constipation are found below.\nNeurological disorders multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction stroke spinal cord injuries\nMetabolic and endocrine conditions diabetes uremia hypercalcemia poor glycemic control hypothyroidism\nSystemic disorders amyloidosis lupus scleroderma\nIntestinal obstruction, scar tissue\u2014also called adhesions\u2014diverticulosis, tumors, colorectal stricture, Hirschsprung disease, or cancer can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum and cause constipation.\nThe two types of constipation are idiopathic constipation and functional constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant symptoms of constipation is categorized separately.\nIdiopathic\u2014of unknown origin\u2014constipation does not respond to standard treatment.\nFunctional constipation means that the bowel is healthy but not working properly. Functional constipation is often the result of poor dietary habits and lifestyle. It occurs in both children and adults and is most common in women. Colonic inertia, delayed transit, and pelvic floor dysfunction are three types of functional constipation. Colonic inertia and delayed transit are caused by a decrease in muscle activity in the colon. These syndromes may affect the entire colon or may be confined to the lower, or sigmoid, colon.\nPelvic floor dysfunction is caused by a weakness of the muscles in the pelvis surrounding the anus and rectum. However, because this group of muscles is voluntarily controlled to some extent, biofeedback training is somewhat successful in retraining the muscles to function normally and improving the ability to have a bowel movement.\nFunctional constipation that stems from problems in the structure of the anus and rectum is known as anorectal dysfunction, or anismus. These abnormalities result in an inability to relax the rectal and anal muscles that allow stool to exit.\nPeople with IBS having predominantly constipation also have pain and bloating as part of their symptoms."

        "output": "The tests the doctor performs depend on the duration and severity of the constipation, the person\u2019s age, and whether blood in stools, recent changes in bowel habits, or weight loss have occurred. Most people with constipation do not need extensive testing and can be treated with changes in diet and exercise. For example, in young people with mild symptoms, a medical history and physical exam may be all that is needed for diagnosis and treatment. Medical History\nThe doctor may ask a patient to describe his or her constipation, including duration of symptoms, frequency of bowel movements, consistency of stools, presence of blood in the stool, and toilet habits\u2014how often and where one has bowel movements. A record of eating habits, medication, and level of physical activity will also help the doctor determine the cause of constipation.\nThe clinical definition of constipation is having any two of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks\u2014not always consecutive\u2014in the previous 12 months:\nstraining during bowel movements lumpy or hard stool sensation of incomplete evacuation sensation of anorectal blockage/obstruction fewer than three bowel movements per week\nA physical exam may include a rectal exam with a gloved, lubricated finger to evaluate the tone of the muscle that closes off the anus\u2014also called anal sphincter\u2014and to detect tenderness, obstruction, or blood. In some cases, blood and thyroid tests may be necessary to look for thyroid disease and serum calcium or to rule out inflammatory, metabolic, and other disorders.\nExtensive testing usually is reserved for people with severe symptoms, for those with sudden changes in the number and consistency of bowel movements or blood in the stool, and older adults. Additional tests that may be used to evaluate constipation include\na colorectal transit study anorectal function tests a defecography\nBecause of an increased risk of colorectal cancer in older adults, the doctor may use tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a\nbarium enema x ray sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\nColorectal transit study. This test shows how well food moves through the colon. The patient swallows capsules containing small markers that are visible on an x ray. The movement of the markers through the colon is monitored by abdominal x rays taken several times 3 to 7 days after the capsule is swallowed. The patient eats a high-fiber diet during the course of this test.\nAnorectal function tests. These tests diagnose constipation caused by abnormal functioning of the anus or rectum\u2014also called anorectal function.\nAnorectal manometry evaluates anal sphincter muscle function. For this test, a catheter or air-filled balloon is inserted into the anus and slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. Balloon expulsion tests consist of filling a balloon with varying amounts of water after it has been rectally inserted. Then the patient is asked to expel the balloon. The inability to expel a balloon filled with less than 150 mL of water may indicate a decrease in bowel function.\nDefecography is an x ray of the anorectal area that evaluates completeness of stool elimination, identifies anorectal abnormalities, and evaluates rectal muscle contractions and relaxation. During the exam, the doctor fills the rectum with a soft paste that is the same consistency as stool. The patient sits on a toilet positioned inside an x-ray machine, then relaxes and squeezes the anus to expel the paste. The doctor studies the x rays for anorectal problems that occurred as the paste was expelled.\nBarium enema x ray. This exam involves viewing the rectum, colon, and lower part of the small intestine to locate problems. This part of the digestive tract is known as the bowel. This test may show intestinal obstruction and Hirschsprung disease, which is a lack of nerves within the colon.\nThe night before the test, bowel cleansing, also called bowel prep, is necessary to clear the lower digestive tract. The patient drinks a special liquid to flush out the bowel. A clean bowel is important, because even a small amount of stool in the colon can hide details and result in an incomplete exam.\nBecause the colon does not show up well on x rays, the doctor fills it with barium, a chalky liquid that makes the area visible. Once the mixture coats the inside of the colon and rectum, x rays are taken that show their shape and condition. The patient may feel some abdominal cramping when the barium fills the colon but usually feels little discomfort after the procedure. Stools may be white in color for a few days after the exam.\nSigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. An examination of the rectum and lower, or sigmoid, colon is called a sigmoidoscopy. An examination of the rectum and entire colon is called a colonoscopy.\nThe person usually has a liquid dinner the night before a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and takes an enema early the next morning. An enema an hour before the test may also be necessary.\nTo perform a sigmoidoscopy, the doctor uses a long, flexible tube with a light on the end, called a sigmoidoscope, to view the rectum and lower colon. The patient is lightly sedated before the exam. First, the doctor examines the rectum with a gloved, lubricated finger. Then, the sigmoidoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and lower colon. The procedure may cause abdominal pressure and a mild sensation of wanting to move the bowels. The doctor may fill the colon with air to get a better view. The air can cause mild cramping.\nTo perform a colonoscopy, the doctor uses a flexible tube with a light on the end, called a colonoscope, to view the entire colon. This tube is longer than a sigmoidoscope. During the exam, the patient lies on his or her side, and the doctor inserts the tube through the anus and rectum into the colon. If an abnormality is seen, the doctor can use the colonoscope to remove a small piece of tissue for examination (biopsy). The patient may feel gassy and bloated after the procedure."

Chronic diarrhea is usually related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.\nA few of the more common causes of diarrhea include the following:\nBacterial infections. Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest food components such as artificial sweeteners and lactose\u2014the sugar found in milk. Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium. Reaction to medicines. Antibiotics, blood pressure medications, cancer drugs, and antacids containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea. Intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea. Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.\nSome people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon after gallbladder surgery.\nPeople who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler\u2019s diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Traveler\u2019s diarrhea can be a problem for people visiting developing countries. Visitors to the United States, Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for traveler\u2019s diarrhea.\nIn many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own, an extensive search for the cause is not usually necessary."

Normally, bilirubin is made in the liver and the liver excretes it into bile. Then bile goes into the intestines eventually leaving the body in the stool. Once the common bile duct becomes blocked, bile can't reach the intestines, and the level of bilirubin builds up. If the bile duct is blocked, bilirubin cannot get through to the intestines then stools may become lighter in color. Abdominal pain: Experiencing abdominal pain due to gallbladder cancer is because advanced gallbladder cancer start to compress other nearby organs. The pain may be constant or it may come and go. Gallbladder enlargement or lump in abdomen: Is because the cancer blocks the bile duct and bile builds up in the gallbladder to enlarge. Sometimes a doctor can feel this enlargement during the physical exam Digestive problems: Patients with gallbladder cancer are unable to digest fatty foods when cancer blocks the release of the bile into the intestine.

        "output": "The reason some people develop GERD is still unclear. However, research shows that in people with GERD, the LES relaxes while the rest of the esophagus is working. Anatomical abnormalities such as a hiatal hernia may also contribute to GERD. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach and the LES move above the diaphragm, the muscle wall that separates the stomach from the chest. Normally, the diaphragm helps the LES keep acid from rising up into the esophagus. When a hiatal hernia is present, acid reflux can occur more easily. A hiatal hernia can occur in people of any age and is most often a normal finding in otherwise healthy people over age 50. Most of the time, a hiatal hernia produces no symptoms.\nOther factors that may contribute to GERD include:\nObesity Pregnancy Smoking\nCommon foods that can worsen reflux symptoms include:\nCitrus fruits Chocolate Drinks with caffeine or alcohol Fatty and fried foods Garlic and onions Mint flavorings Spicy foods Tomato-based foods, like spaghetti sauce, salsa, chili, and pizza."

        "output": "After performing a full physical exam and taking your medical history, your doctor may order several blood tests to check blood counts and chemical and electrolyte levels. To rule out an obstruction or other conditions, the doctor may perform the following tests:\nUpper endoscopy. After giving you a sedative to help you become drowsy, the doctor passes a long, thin tube called an endoscope through your mouth and gently guides it down the throat, also called the esophagus, into the stomach. Through the endoscope, the doctor can look at the lining of the stomach to check for any abnormalities. Ultrasound. To rule out gallbladder disease and pancreatitis as sources of the problem, you may have an ultrasound test, which uses harmless sound waves to outline and define the shape of the gallbladder and pancreas. Barium x ray. After fasting for 12 hours, you will drink a thick liquid called barium, which coats the stomach, making it show up on the x ray. If you have diabetes, your doctor may have special instructions about fasting. Normally, the stomach will be empty of all food after 12 hours of fasting. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach. Because a person with gastroparesis can sometimes have normal emptying, the doctor may repeat the test another day if gastroparesis is suspected.\nOnce other causes have been ruled out, the doctor will perform one of the following gastric emptying tests to confirm a diagnosis of gastroparesis.\nGastric emptying scintigraphy. This test involves eating a bland meal, such as eggs or egg substitute, that contains a small amount of a radioactive substance, called radioisotope, that shows up on scans. The dose of radiation from the radioisotope is not dangerous. The scan measures the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. When more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. Breath test. After ingestion of a meal containing a small amount of isotope, breath samples are taken to measure the presence of the isotope in carbon dioxide, which is expelled when a person exhales. The results reveal how fast the stomach is emptying. SmartPill. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, the SmartPill is a small device in capsule form that can be swallowed.The device then moves through the digestive tract and collects information about its progress that is sent to a cell phone-sized receiver worn around your waist or neck. When the capsule is passed from the body with the stool in a couple of days, you take the receiver back to the doctor, who enters the information into a computer."

        "output": "Almost everyone has heartburn sometimes. If you have heartburn very often, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Normally when food or liquid enters your stomach, a band of muscle at the end of your esophagus closes off the esophagus. This band is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If this band does not close tightly enough, contents from the stomach can back up (reflux) into the esophagus. This partly digested material can irritate the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms.\nHeartburn is more likely if you have a hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia is when the top part of the stomach sticks up into the chest cavity. This weakens the LES and makes it easier for acid to back up from the stomach into the esophagus.\nPregnancy and many medications can bring on heartburn or make it worse."

In cirrhosis, urinary sodium is not a reliable guide to the development of ATN, as fractional sodium excretion may stay below 1 percent, due to the gradual worsening of renal ischaemia. Other causes may include glomerular disease secondary to Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C,  drug toxicity (notably gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy."

The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances. Throat cancers may be cured in most patients if they are detected early. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, some patients may be cured. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable and treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life. Patients generally need therapy to help with speech and swallowing after the treatment. If the person is not able to swallow, a feeding tube will be needed. The recurrence risk in throat cancer is highest during the first 2 to 3 years of diagnosis. Regular follow-up after the diagnosis and treatment is very important to increase the chances of survival."

        "input": "What are the causes of Irritable bowel syndrome ?",
        "output": "Researchers have yet to discover any specific cause for IBS. One theory is that people who suffer from IBS have a colon, or large intestine, that is particularly sensitive and reactive to certain foods and stress. The immune system, which fights infection, may also be involved.\nNormal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a person who has IBS. It can be spasmodic or can even stop working temporarily. Spasms are sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go. The lining of the colon called the epithelium, which is affected by the immune and nervous systems, regulates the flow of fluids in and out of the colon. In IBS, the epithelium appears to work properly. However, when the contents inside the colon move too quickly, the colon loses its ability to absorb fluids. The result is too much fluid in the stool. In other people, the movement inside the colon is too slow, which causes extra fluid to be absorbed. As a result, a person develops constipation. A person\u2019s colon may respond strongly to stimuli such as certain foods or stress that would not bother most people. Recent research has reported that serotonin is linked with normal gastrointestinal (GI) functioning. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical, that delivers messages from one part of your body to another. Ninety-five percent of the serotonin in your body is located in the GI tract, and the other 5 percent is found in the brain. Cells that line the inside of the bowel work as transporters and carry the serotonin out of the GI tract. People with IBS, however, have diminished receptor activity, causing abnormal levels of serotonin to exist in the GI tract. As a result, they experience problems with bowel movement, motility, and sensation\u2014having more sensitive pain receptors in their GI tract. Researchers have reported that IBS may be caused by a bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies show that people who have had gastroenteritis sometimes develop IBS, otherwise called post-infectious IBS. Researchers have also found very mild celiac disease in some people with symptoms similar to IBS. People with celiac disease cannot digest gluten, a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley. People with celiac disease cannot eat these foods without becoming very sick because their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. A blood test can determine whether celiac disease may be present."

        "output": "In its earliest stages, hepatocellular carcinoma does not cause any symptoms. When the tumors grow larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:\nAbdominal pain and vague abdominal fullness: At first the location of the abdominal pain you are experiencing may be isolated on the upper-right part of your abdomen. It is usually relatively mild pain or no pain at all that is present with this life-threatening condition. With the development of cancer, abdominal pain is usually persistent. Abdominal lump: People cannot find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the tumor begins to enlarge, the lump may be obvious in the abdominal region. Jaundice and itching: This is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and obstruction of bile in the bile ducts. Nausea and vomiting: Hepatocellular carcinoma disturbs the normal functions of digestion. Vomiting blood: This symptom is attributed to many factors such as dysfunction of the liver and spleen. Loss of appetite General decline in health Weakness or fatigue Fever\nInfections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."

The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.\nBefore birth, the placenta (the organ that nourishes the developing baby) removes the bilirubin from the infant so that it can be processed by the mother's liver. Immediately after birth, the baby's own liver begins to take over the job, but this can take time. Therefore, bilirubin levels in an infant are normally a little higher after birth.\nHigh levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow. This is called jaundice."

It usually appears between day 2 and 3, peaks between days 2 and 4, and clears by 2 weeks. Physiological jaundice usually causes no problems.\nOther types of jaundice that usually cause no harm include:\nBreast milk jaundice is probably caused by factors in the breast milk that slow the rate at which the liver breaks down bilirubin. Such jaundice appears in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life, and usually peaks during weeks 2 and 3. It may last at low levels for a month or more. Breastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies in the first week of life, especially in babies who are not nursing often enough. Breastfeeding jaundice is different than breast milk jaundice.\nBabies who are born too early (premature) are more likely to develop jaundice than full-term babies.\nConditions that increase the number of red blood cells that need to be broken down, and can cause more severe newborn jaundice:\nAbnormal blood cell shapes Blood type mismatch between the mother and the baby Bleeding underneath the scalp (cephalohematoma) caused by a difficult delivery Higher levels of red blood cells, which is more common in small-for-gestational-age babies and some twins Infection Lack (deficiency) of certain important enzymes\nConditions that make it harder for the baby's body to remove bilirubin may also lead to more severe jaundice:\nCertain medications Congenital infections, such as rubella, syphilis, and others Diseases that affect the liver or biliary tract, such as cystic fibrosis or hepatitis Hypoxia Infections (such as sepsis) Many different genetic or inherited disorders"

In such cases, painful swallowing will resolve on its own with time.\nChronic painful swallowing may be related to another underlying cause. There are several medical conditions that can cause odynophagia. Among the possibilities are:\nCancer: Sometimes chronic painful swallowing is an early sign of esophageal cancer. This is caused by tumors that develop in your esophagus. Esophageal cancer may develop from long-term smoking, alcohol abuse, or persistent heartburn. It can also be hereditary. Candida infection: This is a type of fungal (yeast) infection that may occur in your mouth. It can spread and cause esophageal symptoms like painful swallowing. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This develops from the lower sphincter in the esophagus not closing properly. As a result, stomach acid leaks back into the esophagus. You might have GERD if you experience painful swallowing along with other symptoms, such as heartburn or chest pain. HIV: Esophagus problems occur often in people with HIV. According to the AIDS Education and Treatment Center Program, Candida infection is the most common cause. Sometimes antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV result in acid reflux. This can then lead to other symptoms like odynophagia. Ulcers: These are sores that can occur in your mouth, throat, or esophagus, as well as your stomach. Ulcers may also be caused by untreated GERD. The long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), can increase your risk of ulcers.\nOdynophagia can also be caused by medical treatments, such as radiation therapy for cancer. Some prescription medications may also lead to painful swallowing."

        "input": "What are the symptoms of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?",
        "output": "The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. These include red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells, which fight infection; and platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. In Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the bone marrow malfunctions and does not make some or all types of white blood cells. A shortage of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell, causes a condition called neutropenia. Most people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome have at least occasional episodes of neutropenia, which makes them more vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia, recurrent ear infections (otitis media), and skin infections. Less commonly, bone marrow abnormalities lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which causes fatigue and weakness, or a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.\nShwachman-Diamond syndrome also affects the pancreas, which is an organ that plays an essential role in digestion. One of this organ's main functions is to produce enzymes that help break down and use the nutrients from food. In most infants with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the pancreas does not produce enough of these enzymes. This condition is known as pancreatic insufficiency. Infants with pancreatic insufficiency have trouble digesting food and absorbing nutrients that are needed for growth. As a result, they often have fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea); are slow to grow and gain weight (failure to thrive); and experience malnutrition. Pancreatic insufficiency often improves with age in people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.\nSkeletal abnormalities are another common feature of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Many affected individuals have problems with bone formation and growth, most often affecting the hips and knees. Low bone density is also frequently associated with this condition. Some infants are born with a narrow rib cage and short ribs, which can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. The combination of skeletal abnormalities and slow growth results in short stature in most people with this disorder.\nThe complications of this condition can affect several other parts of the body, including the liver, heart, endocrine system (which produces hormones), eyes, teeth, and skin. Additionally, studies suggest that Shwachman-Diamond syndrome may be associated with delayed speech and the delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking."

Tests such as nuchal translucency ultrasound, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling can be done on a fetus during the first few months of pregnancy to check for Down syndrome. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering Down syndrome screening tests to all pregnant women, regardless of age."

Generally, these mutation (>200 repeats of CGG) occurs at in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1. In around 2% of cases, Fragile X syndrome can occur as a result of point mutation in FMR1 gene.\nNormally, the FMR1 gene makes a protein you need for your brain to grow properly. A defect in this gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all.\nBoys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X is likely to affect them more severely. You can have Fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it."

There are very few outward signs of Fragile X syndrome in babies. Babies may have a large head circumference. Measurement of oversized testes in males who have reached puberty may also suggest the diagnosis. An experienced geneticist may note subtle differences in facial characteristics. Mental retardation is the hallmark of this condition and, in females, this may be the only sign of the disease. A specific genetic test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to diagnose this disease. This test looks for an expanded mutation (called a triplet repea t) in the FMR1 gene."

It affects nearly 1 in 1,000 Americans. The actual number may be more, as some people do not have symptoms. The disorder may not be discovered unless tests revealing the disease are performed for other reasons.\nAn autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease also exists and appears in infancy or childhood. This type tends to be very serious and progresses rapidly, resulting in end-stage kidney failure and generally causing death in infancy or childhood.\nPersons with PKD have multiple clusters of cysts form on the kidneys. The exact action that triggers cyst formation is unknown. In early stages of the disease, the cysts cause the kidney to swell, disrupting kidney function and leading to chronic high blood pressure and kidney infections. The cysts may cause the kidneys to increase production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. This leads to too many red blood cells, rather than the anemia seen in chronic kidney disease.\nBleeding in a cyst can cause flank pain. Kidney stones are more common in people with PKD.\nPKD is associated with the following conditions:\nBrain aneurysms Cysts in the liver, pancreas, and testes Diverticula of the colon\nAs many as half of people with PKD have cysts on the liver."

        "output": "Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it is clear that it develops because of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long period of time. It is likely that the causes include genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Because people differ in their genetic make-up and lifestyle, the importance of these factors in preventing or delaying Alzheimer\u2019s differs from person to person. In a very small number of families, people develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Many of these people have a mutation, or permanent change, in one of three genes that they inherited from a parent. We know that these gene mutations cause Alzheimer\u2019s in these \u201cearly-onset\u201d familial cases. Not all early-onset cases are caused by such mutations. Most people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease have \u201clate-onset\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s, which usually develops after age 60. Many studies have linked a gene called APOE to late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. This gene has several forms. One of them, APOE \u03b54, increases a person\u2019s risk of getting the disease. About 40 percent of all people who develop late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s carry this gene. However, carrying the APOE \u03b54 form of the gene does not necessarily mean that a person will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and people carrying no APOE \u03b54 forms can also develop the disease. Most experts believe that additional genes may influence the development of late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s in some way. Scientists around the world are searching for these genes. Researchers have identified variants of the SORL1, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 genes that may play a role in risk of late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\nA nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits can all help people stay healthy. New research suggests the possibility that these factors also might help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Scientists are investigating associations between cognitive decline and vascular and metabolic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Understanding these relationships and testing them in clinical trials will help us understand whether reducing risk factors for these diseases may help with Alzheimer\u2019s as well."

        "output": "The trajectory of AD is different for each person. If AD develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly. Patients with AD often die earlier than normal, although a patient may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after being diagnosed. The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the patient becomes immobile and totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or a failure of other body systems."

        "output": "One way to find what helps people live long healthy lives is to study those who have succeeded. Centenarians have written best selling books, excelled in sports, piloted airplanes, practiced medicine, danced, sculpted, taught in universities, graduated from universities, run for Congress, and even fathered children.\nThe current documented record holder for longevity was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who lived 122 years and died in 1997. There are reports of older people in some remote villages but there is no documentation to verify the claims (and they live in cultures that give great status to the oldest). Centenarians have become so common, the newest category is \u201cSuper Centenarians,\u201d those 110+ years old.\nThe most definitive research on centenarians is Thomas Perls, MD and Margery\u2019s Living to 100 study of New England centenarians. Interviews with centenarians include Lynn Adler \u2019s Centenarians: The Bonus Years and photographer Liane Enkelis \u2019 incredible photographs and stories in On Being 100. There are quite a few autobiographies and biographies including Jeanne Calment: From Van Gough\u2019s Time to Ours.\nResearch suggests that centenarians have little in common physically. They are physically active people, most don\u2019t smoke, and they typically maintained about the same body weight through their adult life.\nThe role of genetics in longevity is complex. A genetic vulnerability to a life threatening disease, e.g., malaria, reduces life expectancy. If a vaccine or cure is developed, the same genes no longer present a problem. With Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for example, those with the certain apo-E gene patterns have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. When scientists develop a cure, Alzheimer\u2019s will no longer compromise the quality and length of life for those who are at risk.\nThere appear to be genes that foster living longer. Researchers have extended the life of fruit flies by 30% by giving them an extra copy of a gene. Other researchers extended the life of nematodes (microscopic worms) by 500% by removing a gene. It isn\u2019t clear yet why the genetic engineering is extending the lives, but the results are promising.\nDanish researchers compared identical and fraternal twins and extrapolated that only 30% of longevity is genetic. That means that 70% is lifestyle and the choices people make. George Valliant, Ph.D., and subsequent researchers have followed Harvard freshman in the classes from 1939-1949 periodically to the present. One especially notable finding was that men who had traits such as optimism and humor as freshmen were less likely to develop chronic illness or die by age 45. The difference was even more pronounced at age 60."

Patients with Parkinson's disease may feel it difficult to speak and swallow. Slowness of movement (bradykinesia) and impaired balance: In the later course of the disease, patients with Parkinson's disease are likely to take small steps and shuffle with the feet close together. They also have trouble in turning around and keeping balance. These abnormities may result in frequent falls.

Don't skip levels (for example, second-level followed by fourth-level). A Table of Contents will automatically be added to an article that has four or more sections. If appropriate, place subsections in an appropriate order. If listing countries, place them in alphabetical order rather than, say, relative to population of OECD countries, or some random order. ==New section== ===Subsection=== ====Sub-subsection==== A single newline generally has no effect on the layout. These can be used to separate sentences within a paragraph. Some editors find that this aids editing and improves the function diff (used internally to compare different versions of a page). But an empty line starts a new paragraph. When used in a list, a newline does affect the layout (see below). A single newline generally has no effect on the layout. These can be used to separate sentences within a paragraph. Some editors find that this aids editing and improves the function''diff'' (used internally to compare different versions of a page). But an empty line starts a new paragraph. You can break lines without starting a new paragraph. Please use this sparingly. Close markup between lines, do not start a link or italics or bold on one line and close it on the next. You can break lines<br> without starting a new paragraph. It's easy to create a list: Start every line with a star (asterisk). More stars means deeper levels. A newline in a list marks the end of a list item. An empty line starts a new list. * It's easy to create a list: ** Start every line with a star. *** More stars means deeper levels. **** A newline in a list marks the end of a list item. * An empty line starts a new list.

A manual newline starts a new paragraph. When there is a need for separating a block of text the blockquote command will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does. This is useful for (as the name says) inserting blocks of quoted (and cited) text. <blockquote> The'''blockquote''' command will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does. </blockquote> (See formula on right): This is useful for: pasting preformatted text; algorithm descriptions; program source code; ASCII art; chemical structures; WARNING: If you make it wide, you force the whole page to be wide and hence less readable, especially for people who use lower resolutions.

From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body.\nHeart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. This abnormal blood flow is called shunting.\nThe blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen. Less oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue (cyanosis)\nMany of these heart defects involve the heart valves. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward.\nHeart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include:\nTricuspid valve (the valve between the two chambers on the right side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. Pulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. Aortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough.\nOther heart defects that may cause cyanosis include:\nCoarctation or complete interruption of the aorta Ebstein's anomaly Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection Transposition of the great arteries Truncus arteriosus\nCyanotic heart diseases may be caused by:\nChemical exposure Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy Poorly controlled blood sugar levels in women who have diabetes during pregnancy Medications prescribed by your doctor or bought on your own and used during pregnancy Street drugs used during pregnancy"

        "output": "View a TEDx Talk by Dr. Gibson about WikiDoc here\n\"The tribe is smarter than any one\" C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D.\nI grew up as an only child in Oklahoma. One of the only books I had was a single volume of a blue encyclopedia from the 1920s that I bought at a garage sale when I was in second grade. I remember reading as much of that one volume of the encyclopedia as I could, over and over again. I kept it right next to my bed and was mesmerized by it. Eventually Safeway grocery stores gave kids volumes from the Golden Book Encyclopdia once your mom bought enough groceries. If just one young person is inspired by our blue medical textbook/encyclopedia like I was by an outdated encyclopedia, it will have been worth the effort.\nPlease read \"The World is Flat\" by Thomas L. Friedman. One of the premises of this book is that information technology has leveled the playing field of knowledge workers. Silos of knowledge are coming down. Knowledge workers are sharing information freely. Copyright is out, copyleft is in. Those communities that share knowledge most freely, grow and innovate most rapidly. Distributed learning and collaboration are the keys to success in the future. Knowledge workers are demanding free access to shared knowledge.\nThe \"world is flat\", but \"medicine is flat\" as well. It is in the spirit of fostering collaboration among health care providers in sharing medical knowledge that WikiDoc was created. WikiDoc is a global textbook or encyclopedia of medicine that anyone can add to and edit. It is also a source of healthcare news stories. Launched by C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. of Harvard Medical School in 2006, WikiDoc is the first and largest wiki dedicated to medicine on the internet with an initial focus on cardiovascular disease.\nAs a student I struggled to find information for rounds in the morning. As a former Chief Resident at the Brigham and Womens' Hospital, I remember struggling daily to find the latest information for morning report. As a fellow, finding materials for cardiac cath conference was always a challenge at the end of a long, busy day. Learning is a life long struggle and journey. As long as you are learning about a disease state, why not share what you have learned with others?\nWikiDoc is intended to be a shared resource for housestaff (in preparation for morning report), medical students (in preparation for morning rounds) and fellows (in preparation for conferences). Nurses and attending physicians may find it valuable to share and improve upon their fund of general medical knowledge."

If the target substance is in the sample, the test solution turns a different color. When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing."

But in patients with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissue.\nSLE may damage different parts of the kidney, leading to interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous GN. It may rapidly worsen to kidney failure.\nLupus nephritis affects approximately 3 out of every 10,000 people. In children with SLE, about half will have some form or degree of kidney involvement.\nMore than half of patients have not had other symptoms of SLE when they are diagnosed with lupus nephritis.\nSLE is most common in women ages 20 - 40."

        "output": "Plasma is the clear fluid portion of blood. It does not contain blood cells, but it does contain many proteins, including antibodies, which are formed as part of the immune response to protect against infection.\nAntiserum is produced from the plasma of a person or animal that has immunity against a particular infection or poisonous substance. Antiserum may be used to protect a person who has been exposed to a potentially dangerous microorganism against which the person has not been immunized. For example, you may receive a certain type of antiserum injection if you have been exposed to tetanus or rabies. This is called passive immunization. It gives you immediate, but temporary, protection while your body develops an active immune response against the toxin or microorganism.\nDuring serum sickness, the immune system falsely identifies a protein in antiserum as a potentially harmful substance (antigen). The result is a faulty immune system response that attacks the antiserum. Immune system elements and the antiserum combine to form immune complexes, which cause inflammation and other symptoms.\nCertain medications (such as penicillin, cefaclor, and sulfa) can cause a similar reaction. Unlike other drug allergies, which occur very soon after receiving the medication again, serum sickness develops 7 - 21 days after the first exposure to a medication.\nInjected proteins such as antithymocyte globulin (used to treat organ transplant rejection) and rituximab (used to treat immune disorders and cancers) cause serum sickness reactions.\nBlood products may also cause serum sickness."

However, the flow of urine may be blocked in people with a structural defect of the urinary tract, a kidney stone, or an enlarged prostate\u2014the walnut-shaped gland in men that surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen. Urine can also back up, or reflux, into one or both kidneys. This problem, which is called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), happens when the valve mechanism that normally prevents backward flow of urine is not working properly. VUR is most commonly diagnosed during childhood. Pregnant women and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system are also at increased risk of pyelonephritis."

This causes the cells to swell with too much water. Although most cells can handle this swelling, brain cells cannot, because the skull bones confine them. Brain swelling causes most of the symptoms of hyponatremia.\nIn hyponatremia, the imbalance of water to salt is caused by one of three conditions:\nEuvolemic hyponatremia -- total body water increases, but the body's sodium content stays the same Hypervolemic hyponatremia -- both sodium and water content in the body increase, but the water gain is greater Hypovolemic hyponatremia -- water and sodium are both lost from the body, but the sodium loss is greater\nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in the United States.\nCauses of hyponatremia include:\nBurns Congestive heart failure  Diarrhea Diuretic medications, which increase urine output Kidney diseases Liver cirrhosis Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Sweating Vomiting Anti-epileptic drugs -Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the most common AEDs which induce hyponatremia  Recently, other AEDs, such as eslicarbazepine ,valproic acid  have been found to cause hyponatremia."

        "input": "How is the dialysis done?",
        "output": "Hemodialysis works by removing blood from the body and having it flow across a special filter, along with solutions. The filter helps remove toxins. The blood is then returned to the body.\nHemodialysis requires special ways to access the blood in the blood vessels. Access may be needed on a short-term (temporary) or long-term (permanent) basis.\nTemporary access involves placing dialysis catheters (hollow tubes) into larger veins, usually in your neck, chest, or leg near the groin. They are most often used in emergency situations for short periods of time. However, catheters called tunneled catheters can be used for weeks or even months.\nPermanent access is created by surgically joining an artery to a vein, usually in the arm. This vein becomes thickened over time. To perform the dialysis, blood is removed and returned through the vein. There are two methods to create this access:\nAn artery and a vein are directly connected to each other. Then, over a period of months, these blood vessels form a connection called a fistula (an arteriovenous fistula, or AVF). A man-made bridge (arteriovenous graft, or AVG) can also be used to connect the artery and vein. An AVG can be used for dialysis within several weeks. An AVF has a lower chance for infections than an AVG and usually lasts longer before it needs to be replaced.\nDuring a hemodialysis session, one or two needles must be inserted into the fistula or graft.\nIt is important to stick to the diet and medicines the dialysis staff and your kidney specialist (nephrologist) prescribed."

Patients usually have three treatments per week, during which they must sit in a chair for 3-4 hours. Many people feel tired for several hours after the dialysis.\nMost dialysis centers have a very busy schedule. Patients who are late may not be able to make up the time. Because the body continues to make waste products and take on extra fluid between dialysis sessions, you must closely follow a kidney dialysis diet.\nSome people can do hemodialysis at home, avoiding having to travel back and forth to a dialysis center. Home dialysis is usually done using one of two schedules:\nShorter (2 - 3 hours) treatments done at least 5 - 7 days per week Longer nightly treatments done 3 - 6 nights per week while you are sleeping Home hemodialysis treatments help keep blood pressure lower. Many patients no longer need blood pressure medicines. The longer nightly treatments do a better job of removing waste products. They are done more slowly and are therefore easier on the heart and access site (AVF or AGF).\nA dialysis nurse can train patients to do home dialysis. Patients do not have to buy a machine. Supplies can be delivered. Both the patient and any caregivers must learn to:\nHandle the equipment Place the needle into the access site Monitor the machine and blood pressure during treatment Keep records Clean the machine Order supplies"

In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals.\nThe immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units."

In Europe, several observational studies have compared outcomes in patients getting dialysis with those getting IHDF. These have suggested a lower mortality rate and other favorable outcomes in patients getting IHDF vs. those getting ordinary hemodialysis.  However, the issue is not settled at this time, because the required randomized controlled clinical trials have not been done. Another problem has been that in several of the trials done, IHDF was compared to dialysis using low-flux (small pore) membranes, and the benefit found may have been due more to the use of a high-flux membrane than to the addition of convective transport (filtration) to dialysis. A recent Cochrane database review  of available trials could not find a definite benefit of either IHF or IHDF vs. hemodialysis in terms of outcomes."

This is called vesicoureteral reflux.\nOver time, the kidneys may be damaged or scarred by this reflux. This is called reflux nephropathy\nReflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well. Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy.\nReflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including:\nBladder outlet obstruction, such as an enlarged prostate in men Bladder stones Neurogenic bladder, which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions\nReflux nephropathy also can occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter."

Many people, especially as they get older, experience light-headedness if they get up too quickly from a lying or seated position. Light-headedness often accompanies the flu, hypoglycemia, common cold, or allergies.\nMore serious conditions that can lead to light-headedness include heart problems (such as abnormal heart rhythm or heart attack), stroke, and severe drop in blood pressure (shock). If any of these serious disorders is present, you will usually have additional symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms.\nThe most common causes of vertigo are benign positional vertigo and labyrinthitis. Benign positional vertigo is vertigo that happens when you change the position of your head. Labyrinthitis usually follows a cold or flu and is caused by a viral infection of the inner ear. Meniere's disease is another common inner ear problem. It causes vertigo, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.\nMuch less commonly, vertigo or feeling unsteady is a sign of stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizures, a brain tumor, or a bleed in your brain.

Such shaking usually takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control. Many times the caregiver did not intend to harm the baby. Still, it is a form of child abuse.\nInjuries are most likely to happen when the baby is shaken and then the baby's head hits something. Even hitting a soft object, such as a mattress or pillow, may be enough to injure newborns and small infants. Children's brains are softer, their neck muscles and ligaments are weak, and their heads are large and heavy in proportion to their bodies. The result is a type of whiplash, similar to what occurs in some auto accidents.\nShaken baby syndrome does not result from gentle bouncing, playful swinging or tossing the child in the air, or jogging with the child. It also is very unlikely to occur from accidents such as falling off chairs or down stairs, or accidentally being dropped from a caregiver's arms. Short falls may cause other types of head injuries, although these are often minor."

        "output": "Symptoms vary somewhat depending on the location of the injury. Spinal cord injury causes weakness and sensory loss at and below the point of the injury. The severity of symptoms depends on whether the entire cord is severely injured (complete) or only partially injured (incomplete).\nThe spinal cord doesn't go below the 1st lumbar vertebra, so injuries at and below this level do not cause spinal cord injury. However, they may cause cauda equina syndrome -- injury to the nerve roots in this area.\nWhen spinal cord injuries occur in the neck area, symptoms can affect the arms, legs, and middle of the body. The symptoms may occur on one or both sides of the body. Symptoms can include:\nBreathing difficulties (from paralysis of the breathing muscles, if the injury is high up in the neck) Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Pain Weakness, paralysis\nWhen spinal injuries occur at chest level, symptoms can affect the legs:\nLoss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Pain Weakness, paralysis\nInjuries to the cervical or high thoracic spinal cord may also result in blood pressure problems, abnormal sweating, and trouble maintaining normal body temperature.\nWhen spinal injuries occur at the lower back level, varying degrees of symptoms can affect one or both legs, as well as the muscles that control your bowels and bladder:\nLoss of normal bowel and bladder control (you may have constipation, leakage, and bladder spasms) Numbness Pain Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Weakness and paralysis"

They can result from motor vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries (particularly diving into shallow water), industrial accidents, gunshot wounds, assault, and other causes.\nA minor injury can cause spinal cord trauma if the spine is weakened (such as from rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis) or if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow (spinal stenosis) due to the normal aging process.\nDirect injury, such as cuts, can occur to the spinal cord, particularly if the bones or the disks have been damaged. Fragments of bone (for example, from broken vertebrae, which are the spine bones) or fragments of metal (such as from a traffic accident or gunshot) can cut or damage the spinal cord.\nDirect damage can also occur if the spinal cord is pulled, pressed sideways, or compressed. This may occur if the head, neck, or back are twisted abnormally during an accident or injury.\nBleeding, fluid accumulation, and swelling can occur inside the spinal cord or outside the spinal cord (but within the spinal canal). The accumulation of blood or fluid can compress the spinal cord and damage it.\nMost spinal cord trauma happens to young, healthy individuals. Men ages 15 - 35 are most commonly affected.

        "output": "Movement of fluid in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the direction and speed of rotation of the head--for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs that are part of the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.\nThe balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. For example, visual signals are sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings. These signals are processed by the brain, and compared to information from the vestibular and the skeletal systems. An example of interaction between the visual and vestibular systems is called the vestibular-ocular reflex. The nystagmus (an involuntary rhythmic eye movement) that occurs when a person is spun around and then suddenly stops is an example of a vestibular-ocular reflex."

Visual blurring. Disorientation.\nSome individuals may also experience nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, faintness, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, fear, anxiety, or panic.

Individuals who have illnesses, brain disorders, or injuries of the visual or skeletal systems, such as eye muscle imbalance and arthritis, may also experience balance difficulties. A conflict of signals to the brain about the sensation of movement can cause motion sickness (for instance, when an individual tries to read while riding in a car). Some symptoms of motion sickness are dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and generalized discomfort. Balance disorders can be due to problems in any of four areas:\nPeripheral vestibular disorder, a disturbance in the labyrinth.

An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right upon getting out of bed in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is not known, although it may be caused by an inner ear infection, head injury, or aging.\nLabyrinthitis: an infection or inflammation of the inner ear causing dizziness and loss of balance.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease: an inner ear fluid balance disorder that causes episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus (a ringing or roaring in the ears), and the sensation of fullness in the ear. The cause of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is unknown.\nVestibular neuronitis: an infection of the vestibular nerve, generally viral.\nPerilymph fistula: a leakage of inner ear fluid to the middle ear.

        "output": "Diagnosis of a balance disorder is complicated because there are many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions--including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems--and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness should see a physician for an evaluation.\nThe primary physician may request the opinion of an otolaryngologist to help evaluate a balance problem. An otolaryngologist is a physician/surgeon who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck, with expertise in balance disorders. He or she will usually obtain a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to start to sort out possible causes of the balance disorder. The physician may require tests to assess the cause and extent of the disruption of balance. The kinds of tests needed will vary based on the patient's symptoms and health status. Because there are so many variables, not all patients will require every test.\nSome examples of diagnostic tests the otolaryngologist may request are a hearing examination, blood tests, an electronystagmogram (ENG--a test of the vestibular system), or imaging studies of the head and brain.\nThe caloric test may be performed as part of the ENG. In this test, each ear is flushed with warm and then cool water, usually one ear at a time; the amount of nystagmus resulting is measured. Weak nystagmus or the absence of nystagmus may indicate an inner ear disorder.\nAnother test of the vestibular system, posturography, requires the individual to stand on a special platform capable of movement within a controlled visual environment; body sway is recorded in response to movement of the platform and/or the visual environment."

One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon symptoms, medical history, general health, examination by a physician, and the results of medical tests.\nAnother treatment option includes balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include movements of the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote compensation for the disorder. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.\nFor people diagnosed with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, dietary changes such as reducing intake of sodium may help. For some people, reducing alcohol, caffeine, and/or avoiding nicotine may be helpful. Some aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin and streptomycin, are used to treat M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.\nA program of talk therapy and/or physical rehabilitation may be recommended for people with anxiety.\nTemplate:WH Template:WS"

At least 75% of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk of developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone. tobacco and alcohol use are not risk factors for salivary gland cancers.\nInfection with cancer -causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16, is a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers that involve the tonsils or the base of the tongue. In the United States, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer s caused by HPV infectio n is increasing, while the incidenc e of oropharyngeal cancer s related to other causes is falling.\nOther risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:\nPaan (betel quid), immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk of oral cancer.\nPreserved or salted foods, consumption of certain preserved or salted foods during childhood is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer.\nOral health, poor oral hygiene and missing teeth may be weak risk factors for cancers of the oral cavity. Use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content is a possible, but not proven, risk factor for cancers of the oral cavity.\nOccupational exposure, occupational exposure to wood dust is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer. Certain industrial exposures, including exposures to asbestos and synthetic fibers, have been associated with cancer of the larynx. Industrial exposure to wood or nickel dust or formaldehyde is a risk factor for cancers of the paranasal sinuse s and nasal cavity.\nRadiation exposure, radiation to the head and neck, for noncancerous conditions or cancer, is a risk factor for cancer of the salivary glands.\nEpstein-Barr virus infection, infection with the Epstein-Barr virus is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer of the salivary glands.\nAncestry.

        "output": "To find the cause of the signs or symptoms of a problem in the head and neck area, a doctor evaluates a person\u2019s medical history, performs a physical examination, and orders diagnostic tests. The exams and tests may vary depending on the symptoms. Examination of a sample of tissue under a microscope is always necessary to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.\nIf the diagnosis is cancer, the doctor will want to learn the stage (or extent) of diseas e. Staging is a careful attempt to find out whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to which parts of the body. Staging may involve an examination under anesthesia (in an operating room), x-rays and other imaging procedures, and laboratory tests. Knowing the stage of the disease helps the doctor plan treatment."

The patient may look different after surgery, and the face and neck may be swollen. The swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, if lymph nodes are removed, the flow of lymph in the area where they were removed may be slower and lymph could collect in the tissues, causing additional swelling; this swelling may last for a long time.\nAfter a laryngectomy (surgery to remove the larynx) or other surgery in the neck, parts of the neck and throat may feel numb because nerves have been cut. If lymph nodes in the neck were removed, the shoulder and neck may become weak and stiff.\nPatients who receive radiation to the head and neck may experience redness, irritation, and sores in the mouth; a dry mouth or thickened saliva; difficulty in swallowing; changes in taste; or nausea. Other problems that may occur during treatment are loss of taste, which may decrease appetite and affect nutrition, and earaches (caused by the hardening of ear wax). Patients may also notice some swelling or drooping of the skin under the chin and changes in the texture of the skin. The jaw may feel stiff, and patients may not be able to open their mouth as wide as before treatment.\nPatients should report any side effects to their doctor or nurse, and discuss how to deal with them."

It is usually relatively mild pain or no pain at all that is present with this life-threatening condition. With the development of cancer, abdominal pain is usually persistent. Abdominal lump: People cannot find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the tumor begins to enlarge, the lump may be obvious in the abdominal region. Jaundice and itching: This is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and obstruction of bile in the bile ducts. Nausea and vomiting: Hepatocellular carcinoma disturbs the normal functions of digestion. Vomiting blood: This symptom is attributed to many factors such as dysfunction of the liver and spleen. Loss of appetite General decline in health Weakness or fatigue Fever\nInfections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure.

That's why smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars can cause lung cancer and why secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmokers. The more a person is exposed to smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. For more information, see the NCI fact sheets Quitting Smoking and Secondhand Smoke.\nRadon: Radon is a radioactive gas that you cannot see, smell, or taste. It forms in soil and rocks. People who work in mines may be exposed to radon. In some parts of the country, radon is found in houses. Radon damages lung cells, and people exposed to radon are at increased risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer from radon is even higher for smokers. For more information, see the NCI fact sheet Radon and Cancer.\nAsbestos and other substances: People who have certain jobs (such as those who work in the construction and chemical industries) have an increased risk of lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, soot, tar, and other substances can cause lung cancer. The risk is highest for those with years of exposure. The risk of lung cancer from these substances is even higher for smokers.\nAir pollution: Air pollution may slightly increase the risk of lung cancer. The risk from air pollution is higher for smokers.\nFamily history of lung cancer: People with a father, mother, brother, or sister who had lung cancer may be at slightly increased risk of the disease, even if they don't smoke.\nPersonal history of lung cancer: People who have had lung cancer are at increased risk of developing a second lung tumor.\nAge over 65: Most people are older than 65 years when diagnosed with lung cancer."

About one in four cases of bladder cancer is caused by coming into contact with to cancer-causing chemicals at work. These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk. Chemotherapy: The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may increase the risk of bladder cancer. Radiation treatment: Women who had radiation therapy to treat cervical cancer have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Bladder infection: A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.\nSome research has suggested a link between artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer.

As the vitreous shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and the strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina. These are floaters.\nHowever, there are other, more serious causes of floaters, including infection, inflammation (uveitis), hemorrhaging, retinal tears, and injury to the eye."

However, if the floater is a small piece of debris and near the retina it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the sufferer.\nIncreasing background illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow a person to obtain a better view of his or her own floaters. The head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous. \nThe presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12%-16%) as reported in a meta-analysis published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters, especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation."

        "output": "In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. They can be distracting at first, but eventually tend to \"settle\" at the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersome. They usually settle below the line of sight but do not go away completely.\nSometimes a section of the vitreous pulls the fine fibers away from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, which in most cases is not sight-threatening and requires no treatment.\nHowever, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachment. If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment within two or three days or even blindness in the eye."

The disease occurs when these cells slowly start to die off. (The cause is unknown.) The cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea.\nAt first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed. As the disease gets worse, small blisters may form in the endothelium. The blisters get bigger and may eventually break, causing eye pain.

Additionally, symptoms vary based on the specific type of conjunctivitis:\nAllergic conjunctivitis: Main article: Allergic conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is typically itchy, sometimes distressingly so, and often involves some eye swelling. Chronic allergy often causes just itching or irritation. Allergic conjunctivitis often causes pale watery swelling of the conjunctiva and sometimes the whole eyelid. There is frequently a sticky mucus discharge, and there is variable redness. Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as \"pink eye.\" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as' gound') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin. However, discharge is not essential to the diagnosis, contrary to popular belief. Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Like viral conjunctivitis, it usually affects only one eye but may spread easily to the other eye. However, it is dormant in the eye for three days before the patient shows signs of symptoms. Chemical conjunctivitis: Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is irritable or painful when the infected eye is pointed far down or far up. Discharge and itch are usually absent. It show primarily marked redness. This is the only group in which severe pain may occur."

In more than half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth (congenital strabismus).\nMost of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength.\nLess often, problems with one of the nerves or muscles, or Graves' disease restriction may cause strabismus.\nOther disorders associated with strabismus include:\nBrain and nerve disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or Guillain-Barre syndrome Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus) Damage to the retina in children who are born premature Hemangioma near the eye during infancy Injuries to the eye Tumor in the brain or eye Vision loss from any eye disease or injury"

        "input": "What causes Dental cavities?",
        "output": "Tooth decay is one of the most common of all disorders, second only to the common cold.\nBacteria are normally present in the mouth. The bacteria convert all foods -- especially sugar and starch -- into acids. Bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque that adheres to the teeth. It is most prominent on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings. Plaque that is not removed from the teeth mineralizes into tartar. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and ultimately periodontitis.\nPlaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating (the time when most bacterial activity occurs). If this plaque is not removed thoroughly and routinely, tooth decay will not only begin, but flourish.\nThe acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the tooth and create holes in the tooth (cavities). Cavities are usually painless until they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. If left untreated, a tooth abscess can develop. Untreated tooth decay also destroys the internal structures of the tooth (pulp) and ultimately causes the loss of the tooth."

Older infants, who should be responding to familiar voices, may show no reaction when spoken to. Children should be using single words by 15 months, and simple 2-word sentences by age 2. If they do not reach these milestones, hearing loss since infancy may be the cause.\nSome children may not be diagnosed until they are in school. This is true even if they were born with hearing loss. Inattention and falling behind in class work may be the result of an undiagnosed hearing loss problem."

        "input": "What causes Hearing loss in infants?",
        "output": "Hearing loss can develop in children who had normal hearing as infants. The loss can occur in one or both ears, and may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound. Profound hearing loss is what most people call deafness.\nSome cases of hearing loss are progressive (they get worse over time). Other cases of hearing loss stay stable and do not get worse.\nThere are four types of hearing loss:\nConductive hearing loss (CHL) Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) Mixed hearing loss Central hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss results from a problem in the outer or middle ear, such as wax buildup, rupture of the eardrum, or repeated infections. It is usually possible to treat conductive hearing loss with medication or surgery.\nCauses of conductive hearing loss in infants include:\nAbnormalities in the structure of the ear canal or middle ear Buildup of ear wax Ear infections (especially repeated infections) Foreign objects in the ear Injury Rupture of the eardrum Tumors\nSensorineural hearing loss results from a problem with the inner ear. The inner ear is responsible for sending signals to the auditory (hearing) nerve. There is no cure for sensorineural hearing loss. People with this type of hearing loss may benefit from hearing aids or a cochlear implant.\nCauses of sensorineural hearing loss include:\nExposure to certain toxic chemicals or medications while in the womb or after birth Genetic changes or conditions, such as Down syndrome Infection before birth, including cytomegalovirus infection, or infection with German measles during the early stages of pregnancy Infections after birth, such as bacterial meningitis Problems with the structure of the inner ear\nMixed hearing loss is hearing loss that results from a combination of conductive and sensorineural problems. Causes of mixed hearing loss can include any combination of the above SNHL and CHL causes.\nCentral hearing loss results from damage to the auditory nerve itself, or the brain pathways that lead to the nerve. Central hearing loss is rare in infants and children.\nCauses of central hearing loss include:\nDiseases that affect the protective coating (myelin sheath) around nerve cells Tumors"

        "output": "Teeth start to pass through the gums (emerge) during infancy, and again when the primary (baby) teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth. If a tooth fails to emerge, or emerges only partially, it is considered to be impacted.\nAn impacted tooth remains stuck in gum tissue or bone for various reasons. It may be that the area is just overcrowded and there's no room for the teeth to emerge. For example, the jaw may be too small to fit the wisdom teeth. Teeth may also become twisted, tilted, or displaced as they try to emerge, resulting in impacted teeth.\nImpacted wisdom teeth are very common. They are often painless and cause no apparent trouble. However, some professionals believe an impacted tooth pushes on the next tooth, which pushes the next tooth, eventually causing a misalignment of the bite. A partially emerged tooth can trap food, plaque, and other debris in the soft tissue around it, leading to inflammation and tenderness of the gums and unpleasant mouth odor. This is called pericoronitis."

There are also thousands of minor salivary glands around the rest of the mouth.\nAll of the salivary glands empty saliva into the mouth through ducts that open at various locations in the mouth.\nSwelling of the salivary glands is most commonly due to:\nAbdominal surgery Cirrhosis of the liver Infections Other cancers Salivary duct stones Salivary gland infections Sarcoidosis Sjogren syndrome\nThe most common type of salivary gland tumor is a slow-growing noncancerous (benign) tumor of the parotid gland that gradually increases the size of the gland. However, some of these tumors can be cancerous (malignant).\nMalignant salivary gland tumors are usually carcinomas."

Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread out from the root of the tooth and to the bones supporting the tooth.\nInfection results in a collection of pus (dead tissue, live and dead bacteria, white blood cells) and swelling of the tissues within the tooth. This causes a painful toothache. If the pulp of the tooth dies, the toothache may stop, unless an abscess develops. This is especially true if the infection remains active and continues to spread and destroy tissue."

It is also involved in the development of other parts of the body, including the skin and genitals.\nMutations in the IRF6 gene that cause van der Woude syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from making any functional protein.

        "output": "Children develop complete control over their bladders at different ages. Nighttime dryness is usually the last stage of toilet learning. When children wet the bed more than twice per month after age 5 or 6, it is called bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis.\nBedwetting is common. More than 5 million children in the U.S. wet the bed at night.\nChildren who were dry for at least 6 months and then started wetting again have secondary enuresis. There are many reasons that children wet the bed after being fully toilet trained. It might be physical, emotional, or just a change in sleep.\nChildren who have never been consistently dry at night have primary enuresis. This usually occurs when the body makes more urine overnight than the bladder can hold and the child does not wake up when the bladder is full. The child's brain has not learned to respond to the signal that the bladder is full. It is not the child's or the parent's fault.\nPhysical causes are rare, but may include lower spinal cord lesions, congenital malformations of the genitourinary tract, infections of the urinary tract, or diabetes.\nBedwetting runs strongly in families.\nAbout 9% of boys and 6% of girls still wet the bed at age 7. The numbers drop slightly by age 10. Although the problem goes away over time, many children and even a small number of adults continue to have bedwetting episodes."

        "output": "Most of the time, children's testicles descend by the time they are 9 months old. Undescended testicles are fairly common in infants who are born early (premature infants). It occurs in about 3 - 4% of full-term infants.\nOnce a testicle has been found in the scrotum, it is considered descended, even if it is temporarily pulled back (retracted) during a later examination.\nSome babies have a condition called retractile testes, in which the health care provider sometimes cannot find the testicles. This is due to the muscle reflex that retracts the testicles and the small testicle size before puberty. The testicles will descend at puberty. Surgery is not needed.\nTesticles that do not descend by the time the child is 1 year old should be evaluated. Studies suggest that surgery should be done by this age. Surgery can reduce the chances of permanent damage to the testicles, which can lead to fertility problems later in life.\nTesticles that do not naturally descend into the scrotum are considered abnormal. An undescended testicle is more likely to develop cancer, even if it is brought down into the scrotum. The other testicle is also more likely to develop cancer, even if it descended properly.\nBringing the testicle into the scrotum can improve sperm production and increases the odds of good fertility. It also allows the health care provider to examine the testicle to detect cancer early.\nIn other cases, no testicle may be found, even during surgery. This may be due to a problem that occurred while the baby was still developing in the mother (congenital)."

Encourage your child to ask questions. Encourage expression of concerns, worries, or fears. Listen to your child without being critical. Build your child's feelings of self-worth. Use encouragement and affection. Try to involve your child in situations where he or she can succeed. Try to use positive encouragement and reward instead of punishment. Allow the child opportunities to make choices and have some control in his or her life. This is particularly important, because research shows that the more people feel they have control over a situation, the better their response to stress will be. Encourage physical activity. Develop awareness of situations and events that are stressful for children. These include new experiences, fear of unpredictable outcomes, unpleasant sensations, unmet needs or desires, and loss. Recognize signs of unresolved stress in your child. Keep your child informed of necessary and anticipated changes such as changes in jobs or moving"

This crash is accompanied by a strong craving for more cocaine. Additional symptoms include:\nfatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion.\nCocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms like the vomiting and shaking that accompanies the withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.\nIn the past, people underestimated the how addictive cocaine can be.

        "output": "Drug abuse can lead to drug dependence or addiction. People who use drugs for pain relief may become dependent, although this is rare in those who don't have a history of addiction.\nThe exact cause of drug abuse and dependence is not known. However, a person's genes, the action of the drug, peer pressure, emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and environmental stress all can be factors.\nPeer pressure can lead to drug use or abuse, but at least half of those who become addicted have depression, attention deficit disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or another mental health problem.\nChildren who grow up in an environment of illicit drug use may first see their parents using drugs. This may put them at a higher risk for developing an addiction later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons.\nPeople who are more likely to abuse or become dependent on drugs include those who:\nHave depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia Have easy access to drugs Have low self-esteem, or problems with relationships Live a stressful lifestyle, economic or emotional Live in a culture where there is a high social acceptance of drug use\nCommonly abused substances include:\nOpiates and narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness (sedation) and sometimes feelings of euphoria. These include heroin, opium, codeine, meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and oxycodone (Oxycontin).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) stimulants include amphetamines, cocaine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin). These drugs have a stimulating effect, and people can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect (tolerance).\nCentral nervous system depressants include alcohol, barbiturates (amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital), benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. These substances produce a sedative and anxiety -reducing effect, which can lead to dependence.\nHallucinogens include LSD, mescaline, psilocybin (\"mushrooms\"), and phencyclidine (PCP or \"angel dust\"). They can cause people to see things that aren't there (hallucinations) and can lead to psychological dependence. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the active ingredient found in marijuana (cannabis) and hashish.\nThere are several stages of drug use that may lead to dependence. Young people seem to move more quickly through the stages than do adults.\nExperimental use: typically involves peers, done for recreational use; the user may enjoy defying parents or other authority figures.\nRegular use: the user misses more and more school or work; worries about losing drug source; uses drugs to \"fix\" negative feelings; begins to stay away from friends and family; may change friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to \"handle\" the drug.\nDaily preoccupation: the user loses any motivation; does not care about school and work; has obvious behavior changes; thinking about drug use is more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin dealing drugs to help support habit; use of other, harder drugs may increase; legal problems may increase.\nDependence: cannot face daily life without drugs; denies problem; physical condition gets worse; loss of \"control\" over use; may become suicidal; financial and legal problems get worse; may have broken ties with family members or friends."

        "input": "How to do Exposure Therapy?",
        "output": "Some of the rules for constructing a good program of Exposure Therapy are:\nThe subject should have a final goal which should represent non-phobic behavior. This might be (for example) to hold a large snake and rub it against their cheek for several minutes. They should also have in mind a series of intermediate steps such that once they have partially habituated to one step the next is close enough to it that they can readily move on. Such a sequence is called a hierarchy. It may be explicit, in the form of a list of increasingly challenging tasks, or implicit, in the form of a set of principles for escalating the exposure. The therapist will decide which of these will be more useful for the subject. (A useful way of constructing such a hierarchy is the Method of Factors. At every stage the subjects self-exposure should be completely voluntary - a criterion that may be derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance. One important corollary of this principle is that, at every moment, the subject must have an easy way of terminating the exposure. By choosing not to escape - and therefore practising a competing response - the subject thereby weakens the arousal-escape connection. The arousal experienced at any point should be the maximum that the subject is prepared to accept (this is the main difference between Exposure Therapy and Systematic desensitization). It's useful if at each stage the subject asks themselves \"is there anything more I could do?\" By considering which factors they can manipulate they should be able to keep moving smoothly up their hierarchy. Research by Marks and Rachmann citation needed demonstrated that optimum results are obtained with daily practice lasting at least an hour; and that the daily session should be ended by allowing the level of arousal to fall off to around half its peak value. For this reason it's useful for the subject to keep a note of their arousal level on a 0-8 scale (where 0=no arousal and 8=intolerable arousal). Before this fall-off phase the level of arousal should be maintained at an uncomfortable but tolerable level."

Dysexecutive syndrome is defined as \"cluster of impairments generally associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain\" which includes \"difficulties with high-level tasks such as planning, organising, initiating, monitoring and adapting behaviour.\" \nAdele Diamond has recently postulated that the core cognitive deficit of those with ADHD-PI (ADD), is working memory, or, as she coined in her recent paper on the subject, \"childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome\". She states:\n\"Instructional methods that place heavy demands on working memory will disproportionately disadvantage individuals with ADD\". \"language problems often co-occur with ADD, and it is suggested that part of the reason might be that linguistic tasks, especially verbal ones, tax working memory so heavily. Spatial and artistic skills, however, are often preserved or superior in individuals with ADD.\" \"The working memory deficit in many children with ADD is accompanied by markedly slowed reaction times, a characteristic that covaries with poorer working memory in general\". \"Individuals with ADD have difficulty maintaining a sufficiently high level of motivation to complete a task...They go looking for something else to do or think about because they are bored...to remedy a general lower arousal level..\""

This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.\nThe fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff, and decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube). ARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the liver or the kidneys. Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors."

        "output": "Chest tubes are inserted to drain blood, fluid, or air and to allow the lungs to fully expand. The tube is placed between the ribs and into the space between the inner lining and the outer lining of the lung (pleural space).\nThe area where the tube will be inserted is numbed (local anesthesia). Sometimes you will be given medication to make you relaxed and sleepy (sedation) through a vein (intravenously).\nThe chest tube is inserted through a one-inch cut in the skin between the ribs into the chest. It is connected to a bottle or canister that contains sterile water. Suction is attached to the system for drainage. A stitch (suture) and adhesive tape keep the tube in place. After every chest tube insertion, a chest x-ray is done to make sure it is in the right place.\nThe chest tube usually stays in place until x-rays show that all the blood, fluid, or air has drained from the chest and the lung has fully re-expanded. When the chest tube is no longer needed, it can be easily removed. Most people don't need medications to sedate or numb them while the chest tube is removed. Antibiotics may be used to prevent or treat infection.\nIn certain people, the chest tube may be inserted using a minimally invasive technique guided by x-ray or ultrasound. Chest tubes are usually placed during major lung or heart surgery while the person is under general anesthesia."

        "input": "How Does Tobacco Deliver its Effects?",
        "output": "There are more than 4,000 chemicals found in the smoke of tobacco products. Of these, nicotine, first identified in the early 1800s, is the primary reinforcing component of tobacco that acts on the brain.\nCigarette smoking is the most popular method of using tobacco; however, there has also been a recent increase in the sale and consumption of smokeless tobacco products, such as snuff and chewing tobacco. These smokeless products also contain nicotine, as well as many toxic chemicals.\nThe cigarette is a very efficient and highly engineered drug delivery system. By inhaling tobacco smoke, the average smoker takes in 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per cigarette8. When tobacco is smoked, nicotine rapidly reaches peak levels in the bloodstream and enters the brain. A typical smoker will take 10 puffs on a cigarette over a period of 5 minutes that the cigarette is lit. Thus, a person who smokes about 1-1/2 packs (30 cigarettes) daily gets 300 \u201chits\u201d of nicotine to the brain each day. In those who typically do not inhale the smoke\u2014such as cigar and pipe smokers and smokeless tobacco users \u2013 nicotine is absorbed through the mucosal membranes and reaches peak blood levels and the brain more slowly.\nImmediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a \u201ckick\u201d caused in part by the drug\u2019s stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body and causes a sudden release of glucose, as well as an increase in blood pressure, respiration, and heart rate9. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, which means that smokers are always slightly hyperglycemic (i.e., they have elevated blood sugar levels10). The calming effect of nicotine reported by many users is usually associated with a decline in withdrawal effects rather than direct effects of nicotine."
    },
    {
        "instruction": "Answer this question truthfully",
        "input": "Is Nicotine Addictive?",
        "output": "Yes. Most smokers use tobacco regularly because they are addicted to nicotine. Addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, even in the face of negative health consequences. It is well documented that most smokers identify tobacco use as harmful and express a desire to reduce or stop using it, and nearly 35 million of them want to quit each year7. Unfortunately, only about 6 percent of people who try to quit are successful for more than a month.\nResearch has shown how nicotine acts on the brain to produce a number of effects. Of primary importance to its addictive nature are findings that nicotine activates reward pathways\u2014the brain circuitry that regulates feelings of pleasure. A key brain chemical involved in mediating the desire to consume drugs is the neurotransmitter dopamine, and research has shown that nicotine increases levels of dopamine in the reward circuits. This reaction is similar to that seen with other drugs of abuse, and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations experienced by many smokers9. Nicotine\u2019s pharmacokinetic properties also enhance its abuse potential. Cigarette smoking produces a rapid distribution of nicotine to the brain, with drug levels peaking within 10 seconds of inhalation9. However, the acute effects of nicotine dissipate in a few minutes, as do the associated feelings of reward, which causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug\u2019s pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal.\nNicotine withdrawal symptoms include irritability, craving, cognitive and attentional deficits, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. These symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last cigarette, quickly driving people back to tobacco use. Symptoms peak within the first few days of smoking cessation and may subside within a few weeks. For some people, however, symptoms may persist for months.\nWhile withdrawal is related to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, many behavioral factors can also affect the severity of withdrawal symptoms. For some people, the feel, smell, and sight of a cigarette and the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette are all associated with the pleasurable effects of smoking and can make withdrawal or craving worse. While nicotine gum and patches may alleviate the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. Other forms of nicotine replacement, such as inhalers, attempt to address some of these other issues, while behavioral therapies can help smokers identify environmental triggers of withdrawal and craving so they can employ strategies to prevent or circumvent these symptoms and urges."

        "output": "The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ that comes out from the first part of the large intestine. It is removed when it becomes swollen (inflamed) or infected. An appendix that has a hole in it (perforated) can leak and infect the entire abdomen area, which can be life-threatening.\nIf appendicitis is suspected, a doctor will often suggest surgery without conducting extensive diagnostic testing. Prompt surgery decreases the likelihood the appendix will burst. Surgery to remove the appendix is called appendectomy and can be done two ways.\nThe older method, called laparotomy, removes the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of the abdomen. The newer method, called laparoscopic surgery, uses several smaller incisions and special surgical tools fed through the incisions to remove the appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time.\nSurgery occasionally reveals a normal appendix. In such cases, many surgeons will remove the healthy appendix to eliminate the future possibility of appendicitis. Occasionally, surgery reveals a different problem, which may also be corrected during surgery. It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease.\nSometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix\u2014called an appendiceal abscess. An abscess is a pus-filled mass that results from the body's attempt to keep an infection from spreading. An abscess may be addressed during surgery or, more commonly, drained before surgery. To drain an abscess, a tube is placed in the abscess through the abdominal wall. CT is used to help find the abscess. The drainage tube is left in place for about 2 weeks while antibiotics are given to treat infection. Six to 8 weeks later, when infection and inflammation are under control, surgery is performed to remove what remains of the burst appendix.\nAn appendectomy is done using either:\nSpinal anesthesia. Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. General anesthesia. You will be asleep and not feel any pain during the surgery."

Other tests may be done.\nLaboratory tests\nBlood tests are used to check for signs of infection, such as a high white blood cell count. Blood tests may also show dehydration or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Urinalysis is used to rule out a urinary tract infection. Doctors may also order a pregnancy test for women.\nImaging tests\nComputerized tomography (CT) scans, which create cross-sectional images of the body, can help diagnose appendicitis and other sources of abdominal pain. Ultrasound is sometimes used to look for signs of appendicitis, especially in people who are thin or young. An abdominal x-ray is rarely helpful in diagnosing appendicitis but can be used to look for other sources of abdominal pain. Women of childbearing age should have a pregnancy test before undergoing x-rays or CT scanning. Both use radiation and can be harmful to a developing fetus. Ultrasound does not use radiation and is not harmful to a fetus.\nThere are no actual tests to confirm that you have appendicitis. Other illnesses can cause the same or similar symptoms.\nThe goal is to remove an infected appendix before it breaks open (ruptures). After reviewing your symptoms and the results of the physical exam and medical tests, your surgeon will decide whether you need surgery."

Limiting physical activity during this time allows tissues to heal.\nAfter an uncomplicated appendectomy, your surgeon will usually advise you to:\nGet up and walk around the day of the surgery. Keep the incision clean and dry. Avoid lifting. Avoid constipation and straining during bowel movements by drinking plenty of fluids and eating high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains; move your bowels as soon as you feel the urge.\nThe same advice often applies in the case of a ruptured appendix, but over a longer time period. Be sure to call your doctor immediately if you notice:\nSigns of infection, such as fever and chills, redness, swelling, increased pain, excessive bleeding, or discharge from the incision sites. Difficulty urinating, nausea or vomiting, constipation, pain that isn't relieved by available medication, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain."

        "input": "Why and when should a breast examination be performed?",
        "output": "The asymptomatic breast exam is generally performed only on women. This is because diseases of the breast, in particular cancer, occur far more commonly in women then men. Malignancies generally originate in either the glandular tissues that secrete milk or in the ductal structures that transport it to the nipple.\nExamination can be done by the clinician (Clinical Breast Exam - CBE) or patient (Self Breast Exam - SBE). Those performed by the clinician are usually done on an annual basis, beginning at the age of 40, which coincides with time of increased risk for development of breast cancer. Other major breast cancer risk factors include: prior history of breast ca, family history in 1st degree relative (particularly if at a young age), increasing patient age and features that result in prolonged/uninterrupted exposure to estrogen (e.g. early age at onset menstruation, never having been pregnant, older age at first pregnancy, older age at menopause). SBE is often recommended on a monthly-to-every-few-months basis.\nInterestingly, while both SBE and CBE are part of routine clinical care, there are no studies that demonstrate that either of these techniques, when performed as stand-alone examinations, actually improves clinical outcomes (i.e. detects cancer at an earlier stage, demonstrating positive impact on cancer related morbidity or mortality). In contrast, mammography (performed with or without CBE), has a strong body of evidence to support its routine use as a screening tool for early detection of malignancy.\nThe goal of the examination in the setting of symptoms is to better characterize the abnormality, identify underlying etiology, and direct additional evaluation and treatment. Breast related symptoms may include any of the following:\nDiscrete masses detected by the patient, often concerning for malignancy Pain, which can be associated with a number of processes including: cyclical in a menstruating women (reflecting transient hormone induced changes in the breast tissue), occasionally malignancies. Unusual nipple discharge, which may include:\nBlood, concerning for malignancy Milk when not pregnant. Suggestive inappropriate Prolactin secretion from the pituitary - may also be induced by certain medications Other\nDiscoloration or change in the quality of the skin:\nRedness suggests infection or inflammation - in the post partum patient, this is often due to mastitis, a diffuse inflammatory condition caused by congestion from inadequately expressed milk. \"Peau d'orange\" quality - an \"Orange Peel\" like texture that's caused by an uncommon, aggressive inflammatory malignancy\nIf a mass or other abnormality is identified, it's location can be described as being in one of 4 quadrants (left upper, left lower, right upper, right lower) of the breast. Alternatively, it can be described relative to it's position, imagining a clock face were superimposed on the breast.\nIt's worth noting that breast symptoms may be caused by diseases elsewhere in the body. For example, as mentioned above, inappropriate milk production may be due to a pituitary tumor secreting Prolactin. Or breast development in men may signify underlying liver disease. Given this, breast symptoms may merit careful history and evaluation of other organ systems. As symptoms can occur in male or female patients (though overall, female >>> male), evaluation is indicated in either sex patient who presents with breast concerns."

        "output": "Open gallbladder removal surgery\nThe surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your belly to open it up and see the area. The surgeon then removes your gallbladder by reaching in through the incision and gently lifting it out. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (unconscious and unable to feel pain). The surgeon will make a 5 to 7 inch incision in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs. The surgeon will cut the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder. Then your gallbladder will be removed. A special x-ray called a cholangiogram will be done during the surgery. This involves squirting some dye into your common bile duct. This duct will be left inside you after your gallbladder has been removed. The dye helps locate other stones that may be outside your gallbladder. If any are found, the surgeon may be able to remove these other stones with a special medical instrument. Open gallbladder removal surgery takes about an hour.\nLaparoscopic gallbladder removal\nIt is the most common way to remove the gallbladder. A laparoscope is a thin, lighted tube that lets the doctor see inside your belly. Gallbladder removal surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (unconscious and not able to feel pain). The surgeon will make 3 to 4 small cuts in your belly. The laparoscope will be inserted through 1 of the cuts. Other medical instruments will be inserted through the other cuts. Gas will be pumped into your belly to expand it. This gives the surgeon more space to work. First, the surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.

The surgeon will tighten the opening in your diaphragm to keep your stomach from bulging through.\nYour surgeon will then use stitches to wrap the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus. This creates pressure at the end of your esophagus and helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Surgery usually takes 2 to 3 hours.\nWays your doctor may do this surgery are:\nOpen repair. Your surgeon will make an incision (cut) in your belly area (abdomen). Sometimes the surgeon will place a tube from your stomach through the abdominal wall to keep your stomach in place. This tube will be removed when you no longer need it. Laparoscopic repair: Your surgeon will make 3 to 5 small incisions in your belly. Your surgeon will insert a laparoscope (a thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end) through one of these incisions and other tools through the other incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows your surgeon to see inside your belly and do the repair. The surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure if there is bleeding, a lot of scar tissue from earlier surgeries, or the patient is very overweight.\nEndoluminal fundoplication is a new procedure that uses a special camera called an endoscope. The tube is passed down through your mouth and into your esophagus. Your doctor will place small clips on the inside where the esophagus meets the stomach. These clips help prevent food or stomach acid from coming back. An endoscope is similar to a laparoscope. This procedure is done to help prevent reflux."
