He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, and aspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease.
