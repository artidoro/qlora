# Skypilot

[SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) is a framework for easily running machine learning workloads on any cloud through a unified interface which makes it perfect for qlora finetunes.

## Usage

    # use pip install "skypilot[gcp,aws]" for whatever cloud you want to support
    pip install "skypilot"

    # make sure that sky check returns green for some providers
    ./skypilot.sh

This should give you something like this, depending on your cloud and settings and parameters:

    ./skypilot.sh --cloud lambda --gpu H100:1
    Task from YAML spec: qlora.yaml

    Target: minimizing cost

    Launching a new cluster 'qlora'. Proceed? [Y/n]: y


Other, very sensible things to do are to pass --idle-minutes-to-autostop 60 so that the cluster shuts down after it's done. If your cloud provider supports spot instances than --use-spot can be ideal.

Make sure that you either mount a /outputs directory or setup an automated upload to a cloud bucket after the training is done.
